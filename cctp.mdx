## Overview

[Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)](https://circle.com/cctp) is a
permissionless onchain utility that facilitates USDC transfers securely between
supported blockchains via native burning and minting. Circle created CCTP to
improve capital efficiency and minimize trust assumptions when using USDC across
blockchains. CCTP enables developers to build multichain applications that allow
users to perform 1:1 transfers of USDC securely across blockchains.

CCTP V2 supports both **Fast Transfer** and **Standard Transfer**, and also
integrates **Hooks** for custom logic. Fast Transfer enables USDC transfers
between blockchains at faster-than-finality speeds, reducing transfer times from
over 15 minutes to under 30 seconds across most domains. Hooks enhance
crosschain composability by allowing you to trigger automated actions
post-transfer. For more details, see the
[Hooks](/cctp/technical-guide#cctp-hooks) section.

<Note>
**Note:** CCTP V2 uses a separate set of contracts and is not backward
compatible with earlier versions. Developers who need to continue using
Standard Transfer should consider upgrading to the latest CCTP version.

<Accordion title="Understanding the Problem">
Blockchains often operate in siloed environments and cannot natively communicate
with one another. While some ecosystems, such as Cosmos, use built-in protocols
like the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable data
transmission between their appchains, direct communication between isolated
networks, such as Ethereum and Avalanche, remains infeasible.

Traditional bridges exist to address this limitation by enabling the transfer of
digital assets, such as USDC, across blockchains. However, these bridges come
with significant drawbacks. Two common methods, lock-and-mint bridging and
liquidity pool bridging, require depositing USDC liquidity into third-party
smart contracts. This approach reduces capital efficiency, acts as a target for
malicious attacks, and introduces additional trust assumptions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Design Approach">
As a low-level primitive, CCTP can be embedded within any app, wallet, or bridge
to enhance and simplify the user experience for crosschain use cases. With USDC
circulating across a large number of blockchain networks, CCTP connects and
unifies liquidity across the disparate ecosystems where it's supported.

CCTP is built on generalized message passing and designed for composability and
flexible use case enablement. Developers can extend its functionality beyond
just moving USDC between blockchains. For example, you can create a flow where
USDC is sent across chains and automatically deposited into a DeFi lending pool
after the transfer, allowing it to generate yield in an automated manner. This
experience can be designed to feel like a seamless, single transaction for the
end user.

## How CCTP V2 works

CCTP V2 enables seamless and secure transfers of USDC across blockchains through
two transfer methods: **Fast Transfer** and **Standard Transfer**. Both involve
burning USDC on the source chain and minting it on the destination chain, but
the steps and speed differ:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Fast Transfer">

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

**Fast Transfer** is an advanced feature of CCTP V2 designed for speed-sensitive
use cases. It leverages Circle's Attestation Service and
<Tooltip tip="Events are a logging mechanism used in smart contracts to emit information outside of the contract's storage variables. They are emitted, for example, when a token is transferred, allowing smart contracts to inform off-chain applications or users about state changes.">Fast Transfer Allowance</Tooltip> to enable _faster-than-finality_
(soft finality) transfers. The process involves the following steps:

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

1. **Initiation**. A user accesses an app powered by CCTP V2 and initiates a
   Fast Transfer of USDC, specifying the recipient's wallet address on the
   destination chain.
2. **Burn Event**. The app facilitates a burn of the specified USDC amount on
   the source blockchain.
3. **Instant Attestation**. Circle's Attestation Service attests to the burn
   event after soft finality (which varies per chain) and issues a signed
   attestation.
4. **Fast Transfer Allowance Backing**. Until hard finality is reached, the
   burned USDC amount is backed by Circle's
   [Fast Transfer Allowance](/cctp/cctp-faq#what-is-the-fast-transfer-allowance-in-cctp-v2).
   The Fast Transfer Allowance is temporarily debited by the burn amount.
5. **Mint event**. The app explicitly fetches the signed attestation from
   Circle's Attestation Service and uses it to mint USDC on the destination
   chain. A [fee](/cctp/technical-guide#cctp-fees) is collected onchain during
   this process.
6. **Fast Transfer Allowance Replenishment**. Once the burn reaches finality on
   the source chain, the corresponding amount is credited back to Circle's Fast
   Transfer Allowance.
7. **Completion**. The recipient wallet address receives the newly minted USDC
   on the destination blockchain, completing the transfer.

**Fast Transfer** is ideal for low-latency use cases, enabling USDC transfers to
be completed in seconds while maintaining trust and security via Circle's Fast
Transfer Allowance.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Standard Transfer">

**Standard Transfer** is the default method for transferring USDC across
blockchains. It relies on transaction finality on the source chain and uses
Circle's Attestation Service to enable standard-finality (hard finality)
transfers. The process includes the following steps:

1. **Initiation**. A user accesses an app powered by CCTP V2 and initiates a
   Standard Transfer of USDC, specifying the recipient's wallet address on the
   destination chain.
2. **Burn Event**. The app facilitates a burn of the specified USDC amount on
   the source blockchain.
3. **Attestation**. Circle's Attestation Service observes the burn event and,
   after observing hard finality on the source chain, issues a signed
   attestation. Hard finality ensures the burn is irreversible (about 15 to 19
   minutes for Ethereum and L2 chains.)
4. **Mint Event**. The app explicitly fetches the signed attestation from
   Circle's Attestation Service and uses it to mint USDC on the destination
   chain. There might be a fee collected onchain during this step. For details,
   see
   [Standard Transfer Fee Switch](/cctp/technical-guide#standard-transfer-fee-switch).
5. **Completion**. The recipient wallet address receives the newly minted USDC
   on the destination blockchain, completing the transfer.

**Standard Transfer** is suitable for scenarios where longer finality times are
acceptable.

## Use Cases

CCTP enables developers to build novel crosschain apps that integrate
functionalities like trading, lending, payments, NFTs, and gaming, while
simplifying the user experience. Below are some practical examples of how you
can leverage CCTP in your applications—expand any to learn more.

<br />

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Fast and secure crosschain rebalancing">
Market makers, fillers/solvers, exchanges, and bridges can use CCTP to manage
liquidity more efficiently. By securely rebalancing USDC holdings across
blockchains, you can reduce operational costs, meet demand, and take advantage
of market opportunities with minimal latency.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Composable crosschain swaps">
With CCTP, users can quickly swap between digital assets on different
blockchains by routing through USDC. Users can also swap for USDC and
automatically trigger subsequent actions on the destination chain, seamlessly
enabling complex crosschain actions such as swaps and deposits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Programmable crosschain purchases">
Automate crosschain purchases with CCTP. For example, a user can use USDC on one
chain to purchase an NFT on a decentralized exchange on another chain and list
it for sale on an NFT marketplace. When the transaction is initiated, CCTP
routes USDC across chains to buy the NFT and opens the listing on the
marketplace—all in one streamlined flow.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Simplify crosschain complexities">
Simplify the crosschain experience by using USDC as collateral on one chain to
open a borrowing position on a lending protocol on another chain. With CCTP,
USDC can move quickly between blockchains, allowing users to onboard to new
applications without switching wallets or managing multichain complexities.
