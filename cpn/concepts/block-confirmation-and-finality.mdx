When you submit a transaction to CPN, it is initially in the `pending` state and
waiting to be broadcast to the blockchain. Once the transaction is broadcast to
the blockchain, it transitions to the `broadcasted` state, and the transaction
is waiting to be included in a block.

CPN monitors each block of supported blockchains and the status of CPN
transactions on those chains, updating the status as necessary.

## Block confirmation

Block confirmation is the process of validating and adding transactions to a
block on a blockchain. Each time a new block is added to a blockchain, it
confirms the previous blocks.

Without a sufficient number of confirmations, transactions are vulnerable to
alteration through blockchain reorganization. Blockchain reorganization occurs
when validators discard one or more blocks that were previously part of the
canonical chain and replace them with a different set of blocks, rewriting part
of the chain.

<Note>
**Note:** Blockchain reorganizations can happen for a variety of reasons. It's
an engineering best practice to expect reorganizations and make your system
resilient to them.
</Note>

Each additional block confirmation added after a block makes that block less
likely to be removed in a reorganization. Each block confirmation adds
confidence that the transaction is permanently included in the blockchain.

## Confirmation number

For a given block, the confirmation number is the number of subsequent blocks
added to the blockchain.

For a given transaction included in a block, CPN waits for a set number of
blocks (in addition to the original) to be added to the chain before it
considers the transaction final. This number varies across supported
blockchains. When a sufficient number of blocks are appended after the original
block, CPN updates the status of the transaction to `completed` and notifies
both the OFI and BFI of the status change.

<Note>
**Note:** Even if a transaction is visible on a block explorer, it doesn't
necessarily mean that the transaction is considered `completed` by CPN,
because it's possible that it hasn't reached the number of block confirmations
for finality.
</Note>

## Reorganization risk

Although Circle may broadcast transactions initiated through CPN to the 
blockchain network, Circle cannot guarantee that the transaction is 
recorded or permanently confirmed by the network. Transactions over CPN may be 
dependent on underlying blockchain networks that Circle does not control, and 
CPN Participants assume all risks associated with the blockchain network 
operations and any operating changes, including in the unlikely event of a deep 
reorganization or other invalidation of previously confirmed transactions. 

Circle shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from issues with, 
or any delays, reversals, or failures of transactions caused by such operations 
and operating changes.
