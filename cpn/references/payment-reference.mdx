When you
[create a payment with the CPN API](/api-reference/cpn/cpn-platform/create-payment),
you should provide the `refCode` field to carry a meaningful reference for the
transaction. This field can be either an invoice ID or a customer reference. How
this reference appears on the beneficiary's bank statement depends on the
capabilities of the payment rail, which is handled as follows:

- **Metadata support by rail and BFI:** The sender's name (OFI's customer name)
  from the travel rule data appears directly on the recipient's bank statement
  as the ultimate remitter, and the `refCode` appears in the memo field. This
  provides the highest level of transparency for the recipient to recognize and
  reconcile the payments.
- **Partial metadata support:** If the payment rail doesn't support displaying
  the sender's name separately but allows a memo/reference field, the BFI
  populates this memo with a concatenated string in the format
  `{refCode} + {Sender Name}`
- **Minimal metadata support:** If neither the sender name or reference field is
  supported on the rail, Circle returns a `fiatNetworkPaymentRef`, which is a
  rail-specific transaction reference. This ID is visible to the beneficiary on
  their bank statement, and is returned to the OFI by webhook and in the
  [get payment endpoint](/api-reference/cpn/cpn-platform/get-payment).
