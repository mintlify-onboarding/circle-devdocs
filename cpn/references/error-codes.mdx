When an error is encountered, CPN returns an error code and a message. The
sections below show an explanation of each error code returned by the API, and
steps to resolve (where possible).

## Common

| Status code | Error code | Detail                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `500`       | `-1`       | `UNKNOWN_ERROR`         | A generic response for errors that aren't properly handled.                                                                                                                                                         |

Solana requires that you submit signed transactions in 150 blocks (~1 min) of signing them.<br /><br />**Resolution:** Create a new transaction for the same payment and sign and submit it in the appropriate time frame.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `400`       | `290311`   | `SIGNED_TRANSACTION_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH`               | The signed transaction payload does not match the CPN payment. For EVM chains, the EIP-3009 typed data must match the value in the `messageToBeSigned` field returned from the [create transaction endpoint](/api-reference/cpn/cpn-platform/create-transaction). For Solana, the signed transaction object must match the value from the `messageToBeSigned` field.<br /><br />**Resolution:** Resubmit the transaction with the correct payload. |
