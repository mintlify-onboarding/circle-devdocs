Travel rule information is required during payment creation to provide
appropriate regulatory information to the BFI. The following sections outline
the required data that must be securely transmitted to the BFI when a payment is
created. See [JSON Schema](/cpn/references/json-schema) for more information on
how to validate your API response to the travel rule requirements.

<Note>
**Note:** Depending on the geography of the payment route, additional travel
rule information may be required to initiate the payment. This additional data
are specified in the data object returned by the
[payment creation endpoint](/api-reference/cpn/cpn-platform/create-payment).
