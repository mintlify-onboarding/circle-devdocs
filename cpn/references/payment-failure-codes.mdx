When a payment fails, CPN provides a
[failure reason](/cpn/references/payment-and-transaction-failure-reasons) and a
failure code. Depending on when the failure occurs, this information is returned
in the synchronous (API) or asynchronous (webhook) response. This failure code
can help you understand why the payment failed, and take appropriate steps to
resolve the issue. The following sections outline the specific failure codes for
failed payments.
