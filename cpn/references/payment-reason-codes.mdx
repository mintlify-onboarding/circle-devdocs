When you
[create a payment with the CPN API](/api-reference/cpn/cpn-platform/create-payment),
you should include a `reasonForPayment` code in the API request. Each code
provides a specific payment reason.

The following table outlines each code and the reason it represents.

| Reason code | Description                                                                                            |
