When a webhook can't be delivered successfully (2xx status code returned), CPN
continues to try to deliver the webhook. To avoid encountering the same
transient error too many times, the retries are sent with a delay between them.
The number of retries varies between testing and production:

- **Testing:** 6 retries
- **Production:** 11 retries

The following table outlines the schedule for webhook retries:

| Retry attempt | Delay      |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| 1             | 1 second   |
| 2             | 10 seconds |
| 3             | 30 seconds |
| 4             | 1 minute   |
| 5             | 15 minutes |
| 6             | 1 hour     |
| 7             | 3 hours    |
| 8             | 5 hours    |
| 9             | 6 hours    |
| 10            | 10 hours   |
| 11            | 11 hours   |
