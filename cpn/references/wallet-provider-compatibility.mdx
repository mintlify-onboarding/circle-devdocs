CPN allows you to bring your own wallet provider when integrating with the
network. Circle Wallets is an option for your integration, but not a
requirement. When bringing your own wallet provider, you should make sure that
they support the features and signing methods that are required to interact with
CPN.

## Requirements

The following features and signing methods are required for a wallet provider to
be able to integrate with CPN:

- **Custodial wallet support:** The provider must be able to sign transactions
  for wallets without requiring user interaction.
- **Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) raw transaction signing:** The provider must
  be able to sign raw EVM transactions without broadcasting them to the
  blockchain.
- **EIP-712 signing:** The provider must support EIP-712 typed data. The
  resulting signature can be used in one of the following ways:

  - The signature can be verified by recovering the signerâ€™s address with the
    hash of the typed data (on behalf of an EOA).
  - The signature can be validated by the `isValidSignature` method defined in
    EIP-1271 with the hash of the typed data (on behalf of an SCA).

<Note>
    > **Note:** USDC implements EIP-3009 with the EIP-7598 extension, enabling
    > both EOAs and SCAs to authorize transfers via the EIP-3009 mechanism.
</Note>

- **Solana signing:** The provider must support signing raw Solana transaction
  using `Ed25519`, without broadcasting them to the blockchain.
- **Solana memo field:** The provider must support a memo field for Solana
  transactions.

## Quick Compatibility Test

Use this interactive tool to test whether your wallet provider supports the
signing methods required for CPN integration. Test payloads are designed to be
safe, but always verify what you're signing.
