The CPN support ticket API allows you to raise and manage transaction-related
issues including but not limited to:

- Settlement delays
- Missing information
- Refunds

These tickets are stored and managed in the CPN platform, and Circle routes them
to the appropriate party for resolution. This guide provides information on how
to create a support ticket using the CPN API.

## Steps

Use the following steps to create a support ticket.

### Step 1: Gather information

Gather the appropriate information for your support ticket, including:

- Payment ID to be associated with the support ticket
- The type of support ticket:
  - Settlement delay
  - Wrong recipient
  - Incorrect payment amount
  - Request for information on the OFI
  - Request for information on the sender
  - Funding amount discrepancy
  - Reverse funds
  - Other
- A brief description of the problem
- Contact information (email) for follow-up

### Step 2: Generate an idempotency key

Using a UUID generator in the language of your choice, create a UUID to act as
an idempotency key for the API request.

### Step 3: Submit the API request

Make a request to the
[create a support ticket endpoint](/api-reference/cpn/cpn-platform/create-support-ticket)
with the information gathered in step 1, as well as the UUID and any additional
emails that should be included on resolution correspondence. A successful
response from the API includes an ID for the support ticket, a timestamp for
creation of the ticket, and the information provided in the original API call.
