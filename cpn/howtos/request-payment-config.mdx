You can use the API to discover which corridors, currencies, and payment methods
are available. Retrieving this information and handling it in your integration
allows you to show your users the available sources and destinations for funds
in CPN.

## Steps

Use the following steps to request CPN configuration overview, and get the
available routes from country to country.

### Step 1: Request configuration overview

Make a request to the
[configurations overview endpoint](/api-reference/cpn/cpn-platform/get-payment-configurations-overview)
to receive a list of supported currencies, countries, payment methods, and
blockchains.

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}" \
  -X GET https://api.circle.com/v1/cpn/v1/ofi/configurations/overview
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "sourceCurrencies": ["USDC"],
    "destinationCountries": ["BR", "HK", "MX", "NG", "US"],
    "destinationCurrencies": ["BRL", "HKD", "MXN", "NGN", "USD"],
    "paymentMethodTypes": [
      "ACH-BANK-TRANSFER",
      "BANK-TRANSFER",
      "CHATS",
      "FPS",
      "PIX",
      "SPEI",
      "WIRE"
    ],
    "blockchains": ["ETH-SEPOLIA", "MATIC-AMOY", "SOL-DEVNET"]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Request available route details

Evaluate the available route details for a specific transfer by making a request
to the
[supported payment routes endpoint](/api-reference/cpn/cpn-platform/list-routes).
This example evaluates a route from the US to Mexico, but other routes can be
evaluated by changing the query parameters.

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}" \
  -X GET https://api.circle.com/v1/cpn/v1/ofi/configurations/routes?sourceCurrency=USDC&destinationCountry=MX
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "destinationCurrency": "MXN",
      "paymentMethodType": "SPEI",
      "blockchain": "ETH-SEPOLIA",
      "fiatLimit": {
        "min": "168",
        "max": "837500",
        "currency": "MXN"
      },
      "cryptoLimit": {
        "min": "8.34",
        "max": "41552.14",
        "currency": "USDC"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
