When a transaction is created, it's initially in an unconfirmed or pending
transaction state and waiting to be included in a block. Block confirmation is
the process of validating and adding transactions to a block in a blockchain
network. Blockchain confirmations help secure transactions against malicious
actors and ensure the finality of transaction settlement.

By the end of this guide, you will understand:

- The importance of confirmations
- How confirmations are shown in Circle's API platform
- What to consider when balancing transaction settlement speed with the risk of
  a reorganization

## Importance of confirmations

Each time a new block is validated in a blockchain network, it indicates a
confirmation. Without confirmations, transactions are vulnerable to alteration
or reversal through reorgs. A reorg is a rewriting of transaction history which
invalidates recently generated blocks. With each additional block confirmation,
however, it becomes more difficult for an attacker to invalidate previous
blocks.

## Confirmation number

The confirmation number is the number of times a block must be confirmed before
all transactions included in that block are considered final. This allows the
block to reach finality and ensures that all transactions included in that block
cannot be altered or reversed.

The confirmation number varies across different blockchain networks. On Circle's
API platform, a transaction state is `COMPLETED` when the confirmation number
has been reached for the specific blockchain network. In your application, you
can choose to use a `CONFIRMED` state to consider a transaction as valid, though
this means taking on some risk.

## Transaction state

On Circle's API platform, when a transaction is added to a block, it starts in a
`CONFIRMED` state and the wallet balance is updated. The meaning of this varies
for Solana and EVM L2s such as Arbitrum:

- For Solana, `CONFIRMED` means that the transaction is included in a block that
  has been voted on by a supermajority (> 2/3) of the network's stake. This is
  known as optimistic confirmation. To this date, a block that has been
  optimistically confirmed has never been rolled back nor failed to finalize.
- For EVM L2s, `CONFIRMED` means that the transaction has been processed by the
  sequencer. This is known as soft finality. Your acceptance of finality
  completely depends on trusting the sequencer of the L2 chain.

To receive a notification of when a transaction is added to a block, subscribe
to webhook notifications. For more, see
[Notifications Quickstart](/wallets/webhook-notifications). You can also view
transaction details by sending a `POST` request to the `/transactions/{id}`
endpoint.

Once the confirmation number is reached, the transaction state transitions to
`COMPLETED`. If subscribed, you will receive a webhook notification of the new
state.

## Confirmation numbers for supported chains

Taking into consideration historical performance, the potential for reorgs, and
overall network architecture, Circle's API platform uses specific confirmation
numbers for each of its supported chains. This means that all transactions start
in a `CONFIRMED` state and when the confirmation number is reached for a
specific chain, transitions to a `COMPLETED` state.

The following table showcases the confirmation numbers used by Circle's API
platform for each supported chain.

<Note>
  These confirmation numbers are based on Circle's considerations and do not
  necessarily reflect the inherent requirements or limits of the blockchain
  networks.

For transactions on Polygon PoS, Circle's API platform requires 50 confirmations
before transitioning their state to `COMPLETED`. This process generally takes
around 2 minutes. The chosen confirmation number represents three times the
number of confirmations needed for sufficient transaction finality, based on the
largest reorg observed thus far.

## Balancing risk and transaction processing speed

Waiting for multiple confirmed blocks mitigates the risk of a reorg but
increases the transaction settlement time. As a developer, you decide how to
balance the two in your application.

When a transaction state is `CONFIRMED` on Circle's API platform, the wallet
balance is updated. You can display this to your user as a pending transaction,
similar to how banks display inbound deposits. Here are a few ways you could
choose to handle transactions in different states:

- Wait for the transaction state to transition to `COMPLETED`, which ensures the
  confirmation number is reached, before allowing your user to withdraw from
  their wallet balance. There is no risk if you choose to implement this option.
- Allow your user to withdraw funds when the transaction state is `CONFIRMED`.
  The trust associated with this option varies by chain:
  - Solana: `CONFIRMED` means that you are trusting the blockchain's optimistic
    confirmation prior to `COMPLETED`.
  - EVM L2s: `CONFIRMED` means that you are trusting the L2's sequencer prior to
    achieving finality on Ethereum, which is indicated by `COMPLETED`.
  - Avalanche: Transactions immediately transition from `CONFIRMED` to
    `COMPLETED` as Avalanche supports 1 block finality.
  - Other EVM L1s: Risks may vary. Ensure you research the blockchain.

If a transaction is of significant value, it is best practice to wait for its
state to transition to `COMPLETED`. By understanding blockchain confirmations
and the risk of reorgs, you can enhance the security and reliability of your
applications.
