API entities, such as transactions and challenges, are processed asynchronously
after the initial POST request.

As the request is processed, the transaction's state, or the challenge's status,
will update accordingly. This update can be retrieved either by polling the
associated GET endpoint or by subscribing to
[webhook notifications](/wallets/webhook-notifications) (recommended).

## Transaction States

Transactions go through various states after initiation to indicate if they've
begun processing, are identifiable on the blockchain, complete, failed, or
require further action, such as when a transaction becomes `STUCK`.

Specific actions, like canceling or accelerating a transaction, can only be
taken when a transaction is in a specific state.

Canceling a transaction can only occur when a transaction is in the `INITIATED`,
`QUEUED`, or `SENT` states.

Accelerating a transaction can only occur when a transaction is in the `SENT` or
`STUCK` state.

If a transaction cannot be successfully completed, it enters the `FAILED` state
and have accompanying `errorReason` and `errorDetails` fields that describe the
failure.

The following table describes the possible states of a transaction:

| **State** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `INITIATED` | The transaction has been initiated. |
| `QUEUED` | The transaction is in the processing queue. |
| `CLEARED` | The transaction has passed initial checks and risk screening and is ready for further processing. |
| `SENT` | The transaction has been identified in the Mempool and assigned a transaction hash. The transaction may be accelerated at this stage. |
| `STUCK` | The transaction has been sent to the blockchain but could not be included in a block. See how to [handle stuck transactions](/wallets/transaction-limits-and-optimizations#handling-stuck-transactions) to ensure confirmation. |
| `CONFIRMED` | The transaction has been identified on a mined block. The transaction can no longer be canceled. |
| `COMPLETE` | **Terminal State.** The transaction has successfully completed. |
| `CANCELLED` | **Terminal State.** The transaction has been canceled and must be re-initiated. |
| `FAILED` | **Terminal State.** The transaction has failed. The transaction must be re-initiated. |
| `DENIED` | **Terminal State.** The platform denies the transaction. For additional information, refer to the `errorReason` and `errorDetails` fields. |

## Transaction Errors

If a transaction cannot be completed and enters the FAILED state, the
transaction object will have accompanying `errorReason` and `errorDetails`
fields that describe the failure.

| Error Reason | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ESTIMATION_ERROR` | The transaction estimation failed during node execution. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_NATIVE_TOKEN` | The wallet does not have a sufficient balance of the blockchain's native asset to cover the [gas fees](/wallets/gas-fees) needed for all pending transactions. |
| `ABI_SIGNATURE_PARAMS_MISMATCH` | The signature and parameter of ABI are mismatched. |
| `FEE_EXCEEDS_MAX_ALLOWANCE` | The fee exceeds the max allowance. There is one native token fee limit to prevent any unintended transaction from being sent out. |
| `QUERY_NFT_METADATA_ERROR` | The NFT metadata cannot be found. |
| `GAS_LIMIT_TOO_LOW` | The provided fee tolerance (`gasLimit`) was too low to complete the requested transaction. |
| `TRANSACTION_UNDER_PRICE` | The transaction's max fee or priority fee is lower than the current lowest max fee or priority fee in mempool when mempool is full. |
| `FAILED_ON_CHAIN` | The transaction failed to be processed by the blockchain. |
| `FAILED_REORG` | The transaction was dropped because of blockchain re-org. |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | The transaction failed due to an internal error. |
| `PAYMASTER_POLICY_NOT_ACTIVATED` | The paymaster policy hasn't been set or activated. |
| `PAYMASTER_POLICY_EXCEED_MAX_DAILY_TRANSACTIONS` | The maximum number of daily transactions allowed by the paymaster policy has been reached. Please try again tomorrow or update the policy limits. |
| `PAYMASTER_POLICY_EXCEED_MAX_SPEND_USD_PER_TX` | The transaction exceeds the maximum allowable spend in USD as per the paymaster policy for a single transaction. Please increase the limits in your policy for such transactions to go through. |
| `PAYMASTER_POLICY_EXCEED_MAX_SPEND_USD_DAILY` | The maximum daily spending limit in USD set by the paymaster policy has been reached. Please try again tomorrow or update the policy limits. |
| `PAYMASTER_POLICY_EXCEED_MAX_NATIVE_TOKEN_DAILY` | The maximum daily spending limit for native tokens set by the paymaster policy has been reached. Please try again tomorrow or update the policy limits. |
| `PAYMASTER_POLICY_SENDER_IN_BLOCKLIST` | The sender wallet of the transaction is blocked by the paymaster policy. Update the policy blocklist to allow this user to go through. |
| `PAYMASTER_ENTITY_RESTRICTION` | At this time, your account is restricted from using Gas Station. Go to the Developer Services [Console Paymaster](https://console.circle.com/gas-station/paymasters) page to learn more. |

## Challenge States

Challenges go through several statuses to indicate if it has been presented to
the user, have been completed, and more.

If a challenge cannot be successfully completed, it will enter the `FAILED`
state, and have accompanying `errorCode` and `errorMessage` fields that describe
the failure.

| **Status** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| PENDING | The request has been created but has not yet been approved by the user. |
| IN_PROGRESS | The user has approved the request, and it is being executed. |
| COMPLETED | The request is complete. |
| FAILED | The request has failed to execute. The request must be re-initiated. |
| EXPIRED | The request has expired. The request must be re-initiated. |
