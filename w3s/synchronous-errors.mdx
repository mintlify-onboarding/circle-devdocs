The Circle platform returns an
[HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) when
it detects an error in an API request:

- `4xx` errors are client errors, which are informative and actionable. They
  communicate a mistake to the user and suggest fixes.
- `5xx` errors are unexpected server-side errors. See `Description` column for
  more information on the error and potential fixes.

## General error format

[HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) do
not always provide sufficient information to determine the cause of the error,
but the responses to a request typically contain additional JSON fields that
provide additional details. For example, if a request contains an invalid
parameter, the response includes the following:

`HTTP/1.1 400 Bad RequestContent-Type: application/json`

```json JSON
{
  "code": 2,
  "message": "API parameter invalid"
}
```

## Extended error format

In some cases, the response includes extended information about the cause of the
error. For example, if a request doesn't include a value for a required
parameter, the response resembles the following:

`HTTP/1.1 400 Bad RequestContent-Type: application/json`

```json JSON
{
  "code": 2,
  "message": "API parameter invalid",
  "errors": [
    {
      "error": "required",
      "message": "fail to bind request to CreateWalletSetRequest: EOF",
      "location": "field1",
      "invalidValue": "null",
      "constraints": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Developer Services error messages

This section describes some common extended error messages you might encounter
using Developer Services APIs.

### General

The following errors result from malformed request.

### 400 Bad Request

A 400 HTTP status code typically results when the request includes an invalid

with error code `2`.
