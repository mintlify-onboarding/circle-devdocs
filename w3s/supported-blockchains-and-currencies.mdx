## Introduction to blockchains and currencies

If you are unfamiliar with blockchain concepts, a blockchain can be described as
a distributed ledger that records a sequence of actions. It is maintained and
synchronized across multiple computers connected through the Internet. Visualize
it as a decentralized database where participants in the network record their
transactions according to predefined rules to prevent fraudulent or dishonest
actions. Notable examples of blockchains include
[Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) and
[Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum).

Typically, a blockchain supports one or more cryptocurrencies, often known as
tokens. These tokens can represent value and are sometimes interchangeably
referred to as currencies. In most cases, a blockchain hosts a native currency
and may include additional tokens or currencies on the same chain. For instance,
the Ethereum blockchain supports its native currency, Ethereum (ETH), alongside
various tokens such as USDC and EURC. To streamline compatibility and
interaction between different tokens, many adhere to a technical standard known
as ERC-20.

It is worth noting that occasionally, a single currency can be available on
multiple blockchains, expanding its reach and versatility.

## Supported blockchains and currencies

Below is a list of blockchain networks supported by each product. Whichever
Programmable Wallet [infrastructure model](/wallets/infrastructure-models) you
select, user-controlled or developer-controlled, the same blockchains are
supported. The selected [account type](/wallets/account-types), externally owned
account (EOA) or smart contract account (SCA), does affect which blockchains are
supported.

## Support for additional EVM blockchains

If you need a consistent wallet address across multiple EVM chains to ensuring a
direct mapping between the addresses on different chains, you can use our wallet
creation APIs. When you create a wallet address on one EVM chain, you can
replicate and map the same address to another EVM chain. This 1-to-1 mapping
ensures that the wallet address remains consistent and easily identifiable
across the different chains you are utilizing.

### User-controlled wallets

For user-controlled wallets, send a `POST` request to the
[`/user/wallets`](/api-reference/wallets/user-controlled-wallets/create-user-wallet)
endpoint and include the same `X-User-Token` in the header for authentication.
In the request body, pass the new blockchains that you want to associate with
the wallets in the `blockchains` field. The existing EVM wallet address is be
used by default to create the wallets on the newly specified blockchains, which
ensures consistency across chains.

### Developer-controlled wallets

For developer-controlled wallets, send a `POST` request to the
[`/developer/wallets`](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/create-wallet)
endpoint and include the same `walletSetId` that was used for previously created
wallets on another EVM chain. To ensure consistency, provide the same `count`
value as the number of wallets associated with the `walletSetId`. If you need to
obtain the count for a specific `walletSetId`, you can send a `GET` request to
the
[`/developer/wallets?walletSetId=<ID>`](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/get-wallets)
endpoint and include `walletSetId` as a query parameter.

If you only need signing capabilities such as sign transaction, sign typed data,
or sign message on EVM chains, you can create wallets with a `blockchains` value
of `EVM` or `EVM-TESTNET` and use those wallets to sign across different
EVM-compatible chains. This ensures the same address is used across all EVM
chains you support. For more information, see
[Signing APIs](/wallets/signing-apis).

<Note>
  For `EVM-TESTNET` wallets, you can sign transactions on the blockchains listed
  in [Chain IDs for Signing Transactions](/w3s/sign-tx-chain-id). Once you
  transition to Mainnet, you can use your `EVM` wallet to sign transactions on
  any EVM-compatible chains.
