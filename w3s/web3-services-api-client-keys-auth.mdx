You can use API keys and client keys to authenticate requests to Circle's APIs.
Use **API keys** to authenticate and authorize calls to Circle’s APIs from your
backend services. Use **Client keys** to authenticate and authorize calls to
Circle's APIs from your frontend apps, exposed sites, and other public
interfaces. This document explains their differences, usage, and security best
practices.

## Purpose of API/Client Keys

The table below highlights the purpose of API keys and client keys.

| Purpose          | API Key                                                                                                           | Client Key                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Usage**        | Authenticates and authorizes access to Circle W3S RESTful APIs from backend systems. Not safe for public sharing. | Authenticates your client application and grants limited access to Circle's RESTful APIs. Typically used with Circle's SDKs. |
| **Ideal for**    | Services from your backend that leverage Circle's APIs.                                                           | Frontend applications (for example, web or mobile apps) using Circle's serverless SDKs.                                      |
| **Where to use** | Required for serverless cloud apps, micro-services, and client apps to make secure calls to Circle's APIs.        | Required for client applications to make secure calls to Circle's services.                                                  |

## API Key

### What is an API Key?

An **API key** is a unique string used to authenticate and enable access to
privileged operations on Circle’s APIs. It’s required for any RESTful API
requests to Circle services. Without it, requests will fail.

### Keep Your API Keys Safe

API keys allow access to sensitive operations, so they must be secured.

- **Avoid public exposure**. Never share API keys or include them in client-side
  code, public repositories, or other public mediums.
- **Manage securely**. Use your
  [Circle Developer account](https://console.circle.com/api-keys) to generate
  and manage API keys. When generating a key, copy it exactly as displayed.

<Warning>
  **Caution:** Losing control of your API key can result in financial loss.
</Warning>

### API Key Authentication

You can use the headers below to authenticate requests on testnet or mainnet,
respectively.

<Note>
**TEST_API_KEY and LIVE_API_KEY**

The strings `TEST_API_KEY` and `LIVE_API_KEY` are essential components of an API
key. You must include these strings when passing API keys to access Circle's
services.

</Note>

#### Testnet (Test) Authorization Header Example

```text 
authorization: Bearer TEST_API_KEY:ebb3ad72232624921abc4b162148bb84:019ef3358ef9cd6d08fc32csfe89a68d
```

#### Mainnet (Live) Authorization Header Example

```text 
authorization: Bearer LIVE_API_KEY:ebb3ad72232624921abc4b162148bb84:019ef3358ef9cd6d08fc32csfe89a68d
```

### Testing Authentication

To verify your API key setup, you can use the following `curl` command, for
example, to retrieve wallets:

```shell Shell
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.circle.com/v1/w3s/wallets \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>'
```

```json Successful Response Example
{
  "data": {
    "wallets": []
  }
}
```

```json Error Response Example
{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Malformed authorization. Are the credentials properly encoded?"
}
```

## Client Key

### What is a Client Key?

A **client key** is a unique string used to authenticate and authorize API
access for customer applications leveraging Circle's SDKs. A client key is
linked to a specific domain host (for websites), a bundle ID (for iOS mobile),
or a package name (for Android mobile), ensuring access is restricted to
preconfigured applications.

<Note>
  **Note:** A client key must be included in the headers of all modular wallets
  SDK API calls.
</Note>

### Best Practices for Client Keys

Client keys enable access to sensitive application operations, so it’s critical
to protect them. Follow these best practices to ensure their security:

1. **Use separate keys for each application**. Create separate keys for web and
   mobile apps (iOS, Android, etc.) to prevent shared vulnerabilities.
2. **Monitor for misuse**. Set up alerts for unusual activity, such as
   unexpected spikes in API calls, using monitoring tools to detect anomalies.
3. **Rotate keys regularly**. Regenerate client keys periodically and update
   them in your apps to reduce risk if a key is compromised.
4. **Store keys securely**. Use secure storage options like Local Storage or
   Secure Storage for mobile apps, and avoid unnecessary exposure.
5. **Restrict access**. Limit the scope of client keys by associating them with
   specific apps or domains to minimize potential misuse.
