## View API log entries in the Developer Services Console

API logs enable you to view your API transaction history and debug API errors
with no setup required. When an API request is sent, Circle stores it along with
its associated response.

On the API logs page, you can view logs for up to seven days and filter them to
find the specific request you are looking for. Go to your
[Developer Services Console](https://console.circle.com/) to access the logs and
click **Logs**.
