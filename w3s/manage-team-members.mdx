The Circle developer console lets you create and add additional users to your
developer account to seamlessly collaborate with your teammates. As an Admin,
you can easily assign only the necessary permissions each user needs by
assigning them a user role. Each role has distinct permissions and access
levels, letting you set the least permissive access policies for your team
members in a streamlined developer process.

## User Roles

The console displays two roles. You can choose one of the following supported
roles:

1. **Owner (Admin):** When you create a developer account, you are automatically
   assigned an Admin role. As an owner, you will have all the same permissions
   as an Admin, except that this user cannot be removed, and their role cannot
   be modified. It is highly recommended that a person of significant control
   has this role. The person of significant control can be modified by
   contacting customer support.

2. **Admin:** Administrators have full control and can perform all actions
   within the console, including adding and managing users, updating admin
   settings, managing API keys, and using Contracts in the developer console.

3. **View-only:** These users have limited permissions and may only edit their
   personal account information. They can view almost everything in the console
   (see the permissions table below for more details), but they cannot make any
   changes or perform any actions within the console. This role is ideal for
   team members who need access to the account for observation or reporting
   purposes but do not need editing capabilities.

## Manage users on the Developer Console

As an admin user, you can add and remove users, and update user roles. This
allows you to maintain control over access and permissions for your team
members. Use the steps in the following sections to manage users:

- [Add a user](#add-a-user): Learn how to add a new user to your account in the
  developer console.

- [Remove a user](#remove-a-user): Find out how to remove a user from your
  account via the developer console.

- [Update user roles](#update-user-roles): Discover how to modify the roles and
  permissions assigned to a user.

## Add a user

### 1. Navigate to admin settings

Log in using an Admin account. To add more users, click your profile icon in the
top-right corner of the page and select **Admin Settings** from the dropdown
menu.

### 3. Add member details

Enter the new user information, including **email address, first name**, and
**last name**. Select **View-only** or **Admin** to set the new user's
permissions. Select **Send Invite**.

<Note>
**Email addresses must be unique across accounts**

An email address that is invited must be unique across Circle accounts. If you
invite an email used on another developer or Circle Mint account the user will
not be able to successfully join your team.A common workaround to this issue
is resolved by using plus addressing. To do this, append a plus ("+") sign and
any combination of words or numbers after your email address  For example, if
my email were [testuser@email.com](mailto:testuser@email.com) I would use the
email address [testuser+1@email.com](mailto:testuser+1@email.com), and I would
still receive emails to my original email account. Google Workspace and
Microsoft 365 support plus addressing. If you do not use one of these
providers, please check with your email hosting provider before using it.
</Note>

### 4. User accepts invitation

The user will receive an email invitation to join your team. Email invitations
will expire 7 days after they are issued. An Admin can resend an invitation from
the Team page as needed.

They should follow the steps below to join:

1. Open the email invitation and locate the **Join Our Team** button. Click on
   it to proceed.

2. They will be directed to the sign-up form and will be required to review
   their **legal first name**, **legal last name,** and provide a **password**.

3. After filling out the form, click on the **Create Account** button to create
   your account.

4. Once the user successfully creates their account, they will be granted access
   to the developer console in your shared account.
