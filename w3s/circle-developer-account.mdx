## Creating an API Key for Developer Services

To learn more about Circle’s API keys and authentication, refer to the guide on
[API Keys and Client Keys](/w3s/web3-services-api-client-keys-auth).

Perform the steps below to create and register an **API key** from the Circle
Developer account.

1. Sign up with your email address at:
   [console.circle.com/signup](https://console.circle.com/signup)

2. Navigate to **API & Client Keys** from the left sidebar and click **Create a
   key**.

</Frame>

3. Select the **API Key** option, enter the name of your API Key, and choose the
   type of API Key you want to create:

   - **Standard:** Permits the API key read/write to all APIs. This will also
     include access to newly introduced APIs.
   - **Restricted Access:** The API keys can be restricted to control their
     usage and access privileges based on specific Products/Services. When
     opting for restricted API keys, you can customize the permissions
     associated with each key as follows:

     - Select the Product/Service for which the key will have permission:

       - **Webhooks:** Includes endpoints related to
         [Webhook Subscription APIs](/api-reference/wallets/common/create-subscription).
       - **Wallets:** Includes all endpoints for
         [user-controlled wallets](/api-reference/wallets/user-controlled-wallets/create-user)
         and developer-controlled wallets.
       - **Contracts:** Includes endpoints related to
         [Contracts](/api-reference/contracts/smart-contract-platform/import-contract).

     - Furthermore, you can define the specific permissions for each
       product/service assigned to the API key:
       - **No permission:** The API key will not have the ability to invoke any
         APIs for the specified Product/Service.
       - **Read:** The API key will be granted access to read-only GET endpoints
         for the specified Product/Service.
       - **Read/Write:** The API key will have full access to all endpoints,
         enabling both reading and writing operations for the specified
         Product/Service.

<Note>
  Tip: You may also want to add your IP address(es) or range(s) to the IP ALLOW
  LIST to increase security.
</Note>

4. You will receive confirmation that your API key has been generated.
5. You can click **SHOW** to see the API key details.

You’re ready to start using your **API Key** for Developer Services!

## Create a Client Key for Developer Services

To learn more about Circle’s client keys, refer to the guide on
[API Keys and Client Keys](/w3s/web3-services-api-client-keys-auth).

Perform the steps below to create and register a **Client key** from the Circle
Developer account.

1. First, ensure that you
   [create an API key](#creating-an-api-key-for-developer-services) for Web3
   Services.
2. Login to the [Circle Console](https://console.circle.com/), navigate to the
   **API & Client Keys** section, and click **Create a key**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/w3s/images/mw-setup-apiclientkeys01.png" />
</Frame>

3. Select the **Client Key** option and type your client **Key Name**.

Each client key is bound to your application for identification and
authorization. Therefore, depending on your application setup, you may be able
to customize the following fields:

- Web **Allowed Domain**; for example, `your.website.com`, `localhost`, or
  `chrome-extension://<extension-id>`
- iOS **Bundle ID**; for example, `com.yourcompany.yourapp`
- Android
  - Package Name; for example, `com.yourcompany.yourapp`
  - Signature (SHA256); for example, `XX:XX:…:XX` (where `X`: `[0-9A-F]`)

<Note>
**Platform Settings**

1. If you run your web application locally, you can use `localhost` for the
   **Allowed Domain**. If you host your web application under a domain server,
   say `your.website.com`, you can use that domain server URL. For Chrome
   extensions, use the extension’s URL in the format
   `chrome-extension://<extension-id>` as the **Allowed Domain**. You can find
   the extension ID on the Chrome Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).

2. If your application runs on multiple platforms, you can either configure the
   settings for each platform under such **Client Key**, or create a new
   **Client Key** for enhanced security; the latter approach is recommended.

</Note>

4. Verify that the **Client Key** was created.

Once the information provided in the previous steps is validated, the system
generates a client key. Please store it in a safe place, as it won't be
displayed on the Console again.

You’re ready to start using your **Client Key** for Developer Services!
