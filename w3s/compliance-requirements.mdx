This topic describes the compliance requirements you should be familiar with as
you use the Circle platform.

## Addressing OFAC Sanctions in Wallet Management

You must adhere to the Circle terms of service regarding
[OFAC sanctions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ofac.asp) when managing
wallets. Developers must maintain compliance with these regulations and
understand the potential consequences of violating these terms.

## OFAC Sanctions Compliance in Terms of Service

- Developers must ensure that the wallets they create do not transact with
  OFAC-sanctioned addresses.
- Violations may result in reporting to OFAC or banning the developerâ€™s account.

## Actions Taken for Detected Non-Compliant Transactions

Circle takes the following actions for wallets that send or receive transactions
to or from, respectively, any OFAC-sanctioned address:

- The wallet will be temporarily restricted from making outbound transactions
  pending a review.
- The developer should contact Circle Customer Support to move these funds out
  to a quarantine wallet properly.
