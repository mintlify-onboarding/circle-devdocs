Fees for using Circle Gateway vary based on several factors, including the
source blockchain and the size of the transaction. Each transfer includes a base
fee that covers the gas costs incurred during the burn process on the source
chain. In addition to these network-related costs, there is a percentage-based
fee on the transaction size to support operational and infrastructure needs.

Gateway fees are in USDC and collected onchain at the time of the burn from the
user's unified USDC balance. This mechanism ensures that USDC minted on the
destination chain is equivalent to the requested USDC, and also matches the
amount of USDC burned on the source chain.

The base fee is static and determined by the source chain of each burn intent.

Transfers where the source and destination domains are the same don't incur the
percentage-based fee, as these are instant withdrawals from the Gateway smart
contract without invoking crosschain functions.

## Promotional pricing

To support early adopters and encourage adoption, Circle is offering a
promotional rate of 0.005% (half a basis point) on all instant crosschain
transfers. Circle is committed to providing low-cost access to instant,
non-custodial USDC transfers across multiple blockchains.

As the Gateway network continues to scale and mature, Circle may revise this
promotional pricing. Users and partners maintaining high volume and balances
during the promotional period may be eligible to extend the promotional pricing
beyond the standard window.

If you have further questions about the current fee structure or would like to
discuss long-term pricing options, reach out to Circle directly via the Discord
support channel or your Circle account representative.

## Gas fees

Excluding the percentage-based fee charged by Circle for using Gateway, network
fees affect both the base fee charged by Circle and the cost of executing the
mint onchain using the attestation provided by Circle. Generally, the overall
gas cost increases linearly with the number of sources (burn intents) involved
in a transfer.

The gas cost of using an attestation for a single-source transfer is comparable
to the cost of a CCTP mint. Each additional source chain (burn intent) involved
in the transfer adds approximately 60k gas to the mint transaction, which scales
at a slower rate than the cost of the equivalent set of CCTP transfers. Hook
data incurs a cost of about 16 gas per byte for both the mint and the burn.

For reducing overall gas costs, it may be preferable to keep the majority of
Gateway funds on low-cost chains, so that the base fee for the burns Circle
charges for is cheaper.

### Table of fees

source chain. The `maxFee` field of the burn intent must be greater than or
equal to the value shown below, plus the applicable transfer fee.
