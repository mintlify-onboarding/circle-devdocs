Gateway support is divided into two categories:

* **Source Chains** where USDC can be deposited to the Gateway Wallet smart
  contract to create a unified balance.
* **Destination Chains** where USDC can be instantly minted from the unified
  balance.

The following sections show the chains that Gateway supports and their status as
a source or destination chain.

## Required block confirmations

Before updating the unified USDC balance or issuing attestations, the Gateway
API waits for a specific number of block confirmations so that the deposit
transaction is unlikely to be reverted.

The following table shows the number of block confirmations and the average time
to attestation for each supported chain. The average time to attestation is the
time it takes for a transaction to be included in a block and confirmed by the
network.

| Blockchain | Number of blocks | Average time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arbitrum | ~65 ETH blocks | ~13 to 19 minutes |
| Arc Testnet | ~1 | ~0.5 second |
| Avalanche | 1 | ~8 seconds |
| Base | ~65 ETH blocks | ~13 to 19 minutes |
| Ethereum | ~65 | ~13 to 19 minutes |
| HyperEVM | ~1 | ~5 seconds |
| OP | ~65 ETH blocks | ~13 to 19 minutes |
| Polygon PoS | ~2-3 | ~8 seconds |
| Sei | ~1 | ~5 seconds |
| Sonic | ~1 | ~8 seconds |
| Unichain | ~65 ETH blocks | ~13 to 19 minutes |
| World Chain | ~65 ETH blocks | ~13 to 19 minutes |
