## Try it out

"Try it out" modules are available for certain steps throughout our quickstarts. They provide you with an interactive environment to test API requests without needing additional tools or platforms. When you see “Try it out”, you can input your data into the provided parameters and send a request. The response is sent back immediately, mimicking how your request could function in a production environment.

<Note>
"Try it out" input parameters may differ from the actual endpoints' parameters.
</Note>

### Your data and security

Your data's security is our utmost priority. When using our "Try It Out" components, data is only stored within the context of the current page. A page refresh clears all inputted information and removes it. This gives you a secure, risk-free environment in which to play around, if you want. Upon completing our quickstarts, you also have the option to delete your API key.
