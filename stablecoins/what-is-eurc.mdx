EURC is a digital euro issued by Circle, also known as a stablecoin, and
operates on several leading public blockchains. Designed to represent euros on
the internet, EURC is backed 100% by euro-denominated reserves so that it's
always redeemable 1:1 for EUR.

Circle publishes monthly attestation reports for EURC reserve holdings on
[Circle's Transparency page](https://www.circle.com/transparency).

EURC is one of the first fully compliant stablecoins under the EU's Markets in
Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Learn more about how EURC meets these
standards and what it means for builders and businesses in the EU and beyond

## EURC brings the euro into the world of onchain finance

Circle launched EURC to bring the stability and global utility of the euro into
a programmable, interoperable, and internet-native form. EURC combines the trust
and compliance of the traditional financial system with the speed and
composability of blockchain networks.

- **Regulated and transparent**
- **Redeemable 1:1 for euros**
- **Available on multiple chains**
- **Instant, low-cost transactions**

Before EURC, businesses looking to transact in euros onchain had limited
options. Traditional systems for euro payments are fragmented, slow, and often
costly. EURC helps bridge that gap, offering seamless access to the euro in the
digital economy.

By leveraging EURC, developers and businesses can settle transactions, power
DeFi applications, and move money globally using a currency that is widely
trusted and regulated.

## How to access EURC

Qualified businesses can apply for a
[Circle Mint](https://www.circle.com/eurc#circle-mint) account to convert euros
to and from EURC with zero fees and near-instant settlement.

Developers can integrate EURC into their applications across supported public
blockchains:

- Developers with smart contract experience can integrate EURC smart contracts
  directly on [mainnet](/stablecoins/eurc-contract-addresses#mainnet) or
  [testnet](/stablecoins/eurc-contract-addresses#testnet) to build
  euro-denominated flows.
- Developers can use [Circle's APIs](/api-reference) and developer tools to
  integrate EURC into wallets, marketplaces, and financial applications.
