This step-by-step guide teaches you how to write a script to send 10 USDC
between two wallets using the Solana Devnet, which is Solana's testing network.

To better understand the process and its components, you will use third-party
tooling such as Javascript libraries, node services, and wallets. Completing
this tutorial will help prepare you to integrate USDC payment flows within your
app. Building with USDC enables you to move money near-instantly around the
globe using decentralized protocols.

<Note>
**Note: Use Testnet Scripts as Development Framework**

- As with most of our quickstarts, all API calls and transactions in this guide
  take place within the testnet environment; no real-world funds will be
  transferred.

- The sample code in this tutorial can be adapted for real-world transactions
  and can serve as a framework for your further development.

## USDC and Its Token Contract

USDC is a stablecoin backed 1:1 to the U.S dollar and operates natively on
[many public blockchains](/stablecoins/usdc-contract-addresses). Like many
currencies, USDC is powered by a token contract, a programmable piece of code
that manages user balances autonomously across a decentralized network.

As transactions occur, the token contract automatically updates the digital
ledger, ensuring real-time tracking of funds. This mechanism allows individuals
and businesses to send and receive dollars seamlessly, capitalizing on the
transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, you will need the following apps, tools, and
accounts:

1. [Circle Mint Sandbox Account](https://app-sandbox.circle.com/signup/sandbox):
   an account that provides access to testnet USDC.

2. [Phantom](https://phantom.app/)**:** An app for creating wallets, which are
   devices for storing USDC on chain:

   1. Create two wallets, one for sending and one for receiving testnet USDC
      transactions on the Solana Devnet network. These will serve as your origin
      wallet, from which one you send USDC, and the destination wallet, which
      receives USDC. Keep note of the addresses for both.

   2. Make sure you securely record the private key for the origin wallet.

   3. Import the Solana Devnet
      [USDC token contract](https://explorer.solana.com/address/4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU?cluster=devnet)
      into your origin wallet to enable it to read the token balance. Note the
      contract address: `4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU`

<Note>
**Note: Access to the Testnet Scripts**

Refer to our [testnet scripts](/stablecoins/usdc-contract-addresses#testnet).

</Note>

3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): JavaScript runtime environment to run code
   locally on your machine.

4. [Web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/): JavaScript library
   containing functions to call the USDC token contract and initiate
   transactions.

5. Code Editor: A source code editor of your choice. One example,
   [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/), is available as a desktop
   application.

## Tutorial

Follow the steps in this tutorial to transfer USDC on Solana:

## Gather Testnet USDC and SOL

You will need to use native gas tokens to pay the transaction (gas) fee:

1. Configure the Circle sample sandbox application by adding your API key:

   1. **Navigate** to
      [sample-sandbox.circle.com](http://sample-sandbox.circle.com/).

   2. **Click** on the settings (gear) menu in the top right-hand corner.

   3. **Complete** the field for "Your API Key" with the value from your sandbox
      account.

   4. **Click** on the hamburger button in the top left corner to access API
      methods.

2. Mint testnet USDC with a simulated bank transfer using methods in the **_Core
   Functionality_** menu:

   1. **Click** the `POST /businessAccount/banks/wires` menu item.

      1. **Click** the `PREFILL FORM` button and then choose `US BANK ACCOUNT`
         to add a simulated bank account for testing.

      2. **Click** the `MAKE API CALL` button.

      3. Copy the value for the `id` key.

      3. **Click** the `MAKE API CALL` button.

3. Add the SOL wallet address to your address book:

   1. You can use a REST client to make a POST request to the address recipients
      endpoint. The sandbox app does not support `SOL` blockchain:

      ```shell
      curl -X POST \
        --url https://api-sandbox.circle.com/v1/addressBook/recipients \
        --header 'accept: application/json' \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_SANDBOX_API_KEY>" \
        --header 'content-type: application/json' \
        --data '{"idempotencyKey": "<YOUR_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY>", "address": "<YOUR_ADDRESS>", "chain": "SOL", "metadata": {"email": "", "bns": "", "nickname": "" } }'
      ```

   2. Record the value of the `id` from the successful response.

4. **Click** the `POST /payouts` menu item.

   1. **Complete** the `Amount` field with a dollar amount you choose for your
      mock payment.

   2. **Complete** the `id` field with the values you recorded from the previous
      step.

   3. **Click** the `MAKE API CALL` button.

5. Request testnet SOL:

   1. In a new browser tab or window, **navigate** to the
      [Solana Faucet](https://solfaucet.com/).

   2. **Complete** the `Enter Solana account address` field with your Fantom
      deposit address from step 2.

   3. Below the wallet address input field, **select** the amount of SOL tokens
      you want.

   4. **Select** the Devnet environment. Your SOL should automatically be air
      dropped into your wallet upon success.

6. Make payouts in USDC from the **_Payouts API_** menu:

   1. From [sample-sandbox.circle.com](http://sample-sandbox.circle.com/),
      **click** the Payounts APIs menu item.

   2. **Click** the `POST /payouts` menu item.

   3. **Complete** the `Amount` field.

   4. **Set** the `Currency` to `USD`.

   5. **Complete** the `Destination` field with the recipient ID that
      corresponds to your destination wallet address.

   6. **Select** `address_book` from the `Destination Type` drop-down.

   7. **Complete** the `Beneficiary Email` with your recipient email address.

   8. **Click** the `MAKE API CALL` button.

      **click** the Payounts APIs menu item.

   2. **Click**  the `GET /payouts/{id}` menu item.

   3. **Complete** the `Payout Id` field with the value of your payout ID from
      the previous step.

   4. **Click** the `MAKE API CALL` button to check the status of your payout.

## Install Web3.js library to enable API calls

Install Web3.js by running the command below at the command line.

```javascript javasc
// Type this command to install libraries
npm install @solana/web3.js @solana/spl-token bs58
```

## Customize sample JavaScript code by inputting variables

In your text editor, create a new JavaScript file called `send10.js`. Review the
commented code below to understand its structure. Copy and paste it into your
new file:

```javascript Javascript
// Write JavaScript Code
const bs58 = require("bs58");
const {
  Connection,
  Keypair,
  PublicKey,
  clusterApiUrl,
} = require("@solana/web3.js");

const {
  getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount,
  transfer,
} = require("@solana/spl-token");
// Replace these with your own keys and desired transfer amount
const PRIVATE_KEY = ""; // Your private key in Base58 encoding
const RECEIVER_PUBLIC_KEY = ""; // Receiver's public key
const TRANSFER_AMOUNT = 10000000; // 10 amount of USDC to transfer (in smallest unit)
// The address of the USDC token on Solana Devnet
const USDC_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY = "4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU";
// Convert the private key from Base58 to a byte array and create a Keypair
const senderPrivateKeyBytes = bs58.decode(PRIVATE_KEY);
const senderKeypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(senderPrivateKeyBytes);
// Create a new connection to the Solana Devnet
const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl("devnet"), "confirmed");
(async () => {
  try {
    // Fetch the sender's USDC token account
    const senderTokenAccount = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
      connection,
      senderKeypair,
      new PublicKey(USDC_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY),
      senderKeypair.publicKey,
    );
    // Fetch or create the receiver's associated token account for USDC
    const receiverTokenAccount = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
      connection,
      senderKeypair,
      new PublicKey(USDC_DEV_PUBLIC_KEY),
      new PublicKey(RECEIVER_PUBLIC_KEY),
      true, // Allow creating a token account for the receiver if it doesn't exist
    );
    // Perform the transfer
    const signature = await transfer(
      connection,
      senderKeypair,
      senderTokenAccount.address,
      receiverTokenAccount.address,
      senderKeypair.publicKey,
      TRANSFER_AMOUNT,
    );
    // Log the transaction signature
    console.log(`Transaction signature: ${signature}`);
    console.log(
      `You can verify the transaction on https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`,
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error performing the transfer:", error);
  }
})();
```

## Modify the Code

Replace the value of the `PRIVATE_KEY` variable with your secure private key,
which must be in Base58 format. Replace the value of the `RECEIVER_PUBLIC_KEY`
variable with the receiver’s public key.

<Note>
**Note: Transfer amount format**

The set transfer amount value of `10000000` is equal to 10 USDC. This setting is
because ISDC uses a 6 decimal place format, and the amount value should be in
the smallest unit.

</Note>

Save the Javascript file.

## Execute JavaScript code to initiate USDC transfer

From the terminal command line, enter the following command to execute the code
and transfer USDC:

```sh Shell
node filename.js
```

You should see a similar output to the following example if your file executes
successfully:

```text Text
Transaction signature: dsLFw3rtDEWT2b3vpzournXspeTbeEZvzVAh3bmNaLzrqQB7nWrgj4rdh4j9gVb51p4mkDm1ivFUgkuC6Q7aehT
You can verify the transaction on https://explorer.solana.com/tx/dsLFw3rtDEWT2b3vpzournXspeTbeEZvzVAh3bmNaLzrqQB7nWrgj4rdh4j9gVb51p4mkDm1ivFUgkuC6Q7aehT?cluster=devnet
```

Check the status of your USDC transaction by visiting the
[Solana Devnet block explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2Uh8RV7afW1zNeyFoSBP6MXRjoVsdt8ZfGWsSQckPrtj14PaDySPxnTjxiHsuybiPRmzjRTvYSjdHVzRKSPUuUR4?cluster=devnet).
