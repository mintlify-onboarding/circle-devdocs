<Warning>
  **This is CCTP V1 version. For the latest version, see [CCTP](/cctp)**.
</Warning>

## Minter Allowance

The USDC smart contract (or module) on each blockchain specifies a limit for how
much USDC can be minted before the limit needs to be increased by the master
minter, Circle. This limit is called the "minter allowance" and it is
individually set for each authorized minter, such as CCTP V1.

Minter allowance is decremented each time the authorized minter mints, by the
amount of USDC that is minted. A transaction attempting to mint in excess of the
minter allowance will fail, but may succeed on a subsequent retry after the
minter allowance is reset. Minter allowance can be queried from the USDC
contract on EVM-compatible chains using the public
[minterAllowance](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens/blob/0d3cab14ebd133a83fc834dbd48d0468bdf0b391/contracts/v1/FiatTokenV1.sol#L153)
function. For CCTP V1 on Noble, minter allowance can be queried via the
[fiattokenfactory module minters API](https://github.com/circlefin/noble-fiattokenfactory/blob/33b30a6cf87eba20874df84fa93dd100f71ed512/proto/fiattokenfactory/query.proto#L49-L52).

## Per-Message Burn Limit

CCTP V1 defines per-message burn limits. This value is configurable by Circle.
This limit prevents the situation where a user burns an amount of USDC on a
source chain that could never be minted on a destination chain without
increasing minter allowance thresholds. Per-message burn limits can be queried
on the TokenMinter contract on EVM-compatible chains, using the public
[burnLimitsPerMessage](https://github.com/circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts/blob/master/src/roles/TokenController.sol#L69)
mapping. For CCTP V1 on Noble, the per-message burn limit can be queried via the
[cctp module per_message_burn_limits API](https://github.com/circlefin/noble-fiattokenfactory/blob/master/proto/fiattokenfactory/query.proto#L49-L52).
