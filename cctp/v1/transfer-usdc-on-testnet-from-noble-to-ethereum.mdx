<Warning>
  **This is CCTP V1 version. For the latest version, see [CCTP](/cctp)**.
</Warning>

To transfer USDC between Noble testnet and Ethereum Sepolia, follow the
tutorials provided
[here](https://github.com/circlefin/noble-cctp/tree/master/examples).
Specifically, follow the instructions for the
[DepositForBurn script](https://github.com/circlefin/noble-cctp/blob/master/examples/depositForBurn.ts)
to test transferring USDC from Noble testnet to Ethereum Sepolia, and the
instructions for the
[ReceiveMessage script](https://github.com/circlefin/noble-cctp/blob/master/examples/receiveMessage.ts)
to transfer USDC from Ethereum Sepolia to Noble testnet.

As a security measure, these scripts should only be used for testnet testing. It
is not recommended to reuse private keys across mainnet and testnet.

<Note>
**Note:**

This tutorial relies on the Strangelove Ventures
[Noble CCTP V1 relayer](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/noble-cctp-relayer),
which is a service that automatically calls `receiveMessage()` for messages
transmitted to and from Noble domains. To avoid relying on this relayer, you
can submit this `receiveMessage()` transaction directly. (If you do not want
your transaction relayed automatically, you can specify a `destinationCaller`
via `depositForBurnWithCaller()`.)
