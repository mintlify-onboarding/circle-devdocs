<Warning>
  **This is CCTP V1 version. For the latest version, see [CCTP](/cctp)**.
</Warning>

To get started with CCTP V1 on Solana devnet, follow the
[example scripts](https://github.com/circlefin/solana-cctp-contracts/tree/master/examples).
The examples use [Solana web3.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/web3.js)
and [Anchor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@project-serum/anchor) to transfer
USDC to and from an account on Solana devnet and an address on an external
blockchain.

As a security measure, these scripts should only be used for devnet testing. You
should not reuse private keys across devnet and mainnet.
