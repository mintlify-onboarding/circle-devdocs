<Warning>
  **This is CCTP V1 version. For the latest version, see [CCTP](/cctp)**.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

Before signing an attestation for a source chain event, Circle waits for a
specified number of onchain block confirmations to achieve
<Glossary term="hard finality" />.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

The table below shows the average time required for an attestation to become
available after a message is emitted onchain.

<Note>
**Block confirmations for L2s to Ethereum**

Layer 2 (L2) blockchains publish transaction data in batches to Ethereum L1,
and the frequency of these posts varies by chain. Some submit batches every
few minutes, while others are less frequent. After a batch is posted, Circle
waits for the Ethereum L1 block containing the batch to finalize, which
typically happens after ~65 blocks, or 13 to 19 minutes, before issuing an
attestation.
