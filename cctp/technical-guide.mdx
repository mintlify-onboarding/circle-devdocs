## CCTP V2 Message Passing

Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) uses generalized message passing to
facilitate the native burning and minting of USDC across supported blockchains,
also known as
[domains](/cctp/cctp-supported-blockchains#cctp-supported-domains). Message
passing is a three-step process:

1. An onchain component on the source domain emits a message.
2. Circle's offchain attestation service signs the message.
3. The onchain component at the destination domain receives the message, and
   forwards the message body to the specified recipient.

Onchain components serve the same purpose across all domains, but their
implementations differ between EVM-compatible and non-EVM domains. Moreover,
there are both implementation and naming differences between CCTP V2 and
previous versions due to the addition of Fast Transfer and other improvements.

### For EVM Chains

The relationship between CCTP V2's onchain components and Circle's offchain
Attestation Service is illustrated below for a burn-and-mint of USDC between
EVM-compatible domains:

<Frame>
  <img src="/cctp/images/cctp-gmp-archdomains01.png" />
</Frame>

On EVM domains, the onchain component for cross-chain burning and minting is
called **TokenMessengerV2**, which is built on top of **MessageTransmitterV2**,
an onchain component for generalized message passing.

In the diagram above, a token depositor calls the
[TokenMessengerV2#depositForBurn](https://github.com/circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts/blob/63ab1f0ac06ce0793c0bbfbb8d09816bc211386d/src/v2/TokenMessengerV2.sol#L158)
function to deposit a native token (such as USDC), which delegates to the
TokenMinterV2 contract to burn the token. The **TokenMessengerV2** contract then
sends a message via the
[MessageTransmitterV2#sendMessage](https://github.com/circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts/blob/63ab1f0ac06ce0793c0bbfbb8d09816bc211386d/src/v2/MessageTransmitterV2.sol#L143)
function. After
[sufficient block confirmations](/cctp/required-block-confirmations), Circle's
offchain attestation service, Iris, signs the message. An API consumer must
query this attestation and submits it onchain to the destination domain's
[MessageTransmitterV2#receiveMessage](https://github.com/circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts/blob/63ab1f0ac06ce0793c0bbfbb8d09816bc211386d/src/v2/MessageTransmitterV2.sol#L206)
function.

To send an arbitrary message, directly call
[MessageTransmitterV2#sendMessage](https://github.com/circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts/blob/63ab1f0ac06ce0793c0bbfbb8d09816bc211386d/src/v2/MessageTransmitterV2.sol#L143).
The message recipient must implement the following methods to handle messages
based on their finality threshold:

- Implement
  [IMessageHandlerV2#handleReceiveFinalizedMessage](https://github.com/circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts/blob/63ab1f0ac06ce0793c0bbfbb8d09816bc211386d/src/interfaces/v2/IMessageHandlerV2.sol#L35)
  to receive messages with `finalityThresholdExecuted` â‰¥ 2000.
- Implement
  [IMessageHandlerV2#handleReceiveUnfinalizedMessage](https://github.com/circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts/blob/63ab1f0ac06ce0793c0bbfbb8d09816bc211386d/src/interfaces/v2/IMessageHandlerV2.sol#L51)
  to receive messages with `finalityThresholdExecuted` \< 2000.

This distinction allows the recipient to control the level of finality it
requires before accepting a message.

### For Non-EVM Chains

CCTP is also available on several non-EVM blockchains where USDC is natively
issued, extending cross-chain functionality to the broader ecosystem. While most
non-EVM domains support CCTP V1, Circle is expanding support to include later
CCTP versions.

## CCTP V2 Message Format

### Message Header

The top-level message header format is standard for all messages passing through
CCTP.

| Field                       | Offset | Solidity Type | Length (bytes) | Description                                                                                                                   |

| `nonce`                     | 12     | bytes32       | 32             | Unique message nonce (see [CCTP V2 Nonces](#cctp-v2-nonces))                                                                  |
| `sender`                    | 44     | bytes32       | 32             | Address of MessageTransmitterV2 caller on source domain                                                                       |
| `recipient`                 | 76     | bytes32       | 32             | Address to handle message body on destination domain                                                                          |
| `destinationCaller`         | 108    | bytes32       | 32             | Address permitted to call MessageTransmitterV2 on destination domain, or bytes32(0) if message can be received by any address |
| `minFinalityThreshold`      | 140    | uint32        | 4              | Minimum finality threshold before allowed to attest (see [CCTP V2 Finality Thresholds](#cctp-v2-finality-thresholds))         |
| `finalityThresholdExecuted` | 144    | uint32        | 4              | Actual finality threshold executed from source chain (see [CCTP V2 Finality Thresholds](#cctp-v2-finality-thresholds))        |
| `messageBody`               | 148    | bytes         | dynamic        | Application-specific message to be handled by recipient                                                                       |

#### CCTP V2 Nonces

A CCTP V2 nonce is a unique identifier for a message that can only be used once
on the destination domain. Circle assigns CCTP V2 nonces offchain. The nonce for
each message in a transaction can be queried through the
[/v2/messages API](/api-reference/cctp/all/get-messages-v-2), using the
transaction hash as a query parameter.

<Note>
**Why we use `bytes32` type for addresses**

CCTP is built to support EVM chains, which use 20 byte addresses, and non-EVM
chains, many of which use 32 byte addresses. We provide a
[Message.sol library](https://github.com/circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts/blob/40111601620071988e94e39274c8f48d6f406d6d/src/messages/Message.sol#L145-L157)
as a reference implementation for converting between address and `bytes32` in
Solidity.
</Note>

### Message Body

The message format includes a dynamically sized `messageBody` field, used for
application-specific messages. For example, `TokenMessengerV2` defines a
[BurnMessageV2](https://github.com/circlefin/evm-cctp-contracts/blob/master/src/messages/v2/BurnMessageV2.sol)
with data related to cross-chain transfers.

## CCTP V2 API Hosts and Endpoints

CCTP provides a set of API hosts and endpoints to manage messages, attestations,
and transaction details for your cross-chain USDC transfers.

### API Service Hosts

| Environment | URL                                   |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Testnet** | `https://iris-api-sandbox.circle.com` |
| **Mainnet** | `https://iris-api.circle.com`         |

<Note>
**API Service Rate Limit**

The CCTP API service rate limit is 35 requests per second. If you exceed 35
requests per second, the service blocks all API requests for the next 5
minutes and returns an HTTP 429 response.
</Note>

### API Endpoints

CCTP V2 endpoints enable advanced functionality such as fetching attestations
for **Standard Transfer** or **Fast Transfer** burn events, verifying public
keys across versions, accessing transaction details, querying fast transfer
allowances and fees, and initiating re-attestation processes. Below is an
overview of the CCTP V2 public endpoints. Click on any endpoint for its API
reference.

<Note>
**Deprecated endpoint**

The endpoint `/v2/fastBurn/USDC/fees` is deprecated. Use
[`/v2/burn/USDC/fees`](/api-reference/cctp/all/get-burn-usdc-fees) instead to
retrieve both Fast and Standard Transfer fees.

**Note:** This deprecation does **not** affect
[`/v2/fastBurn/USDC/allowance`](/api-reference/cctp/all/get-fast-burn-usdc-allowance)
(see table above), which remains active and valid.
</Note>

## CCTP V2 Finality Thresholds

CCTP V2 introduces the concept of a finality threshold, which is a
chain-agnostic representation of the confirmation level required before an
attestation is issued. This allows integrators to specify how many confirmations
are needed based on their risk tolerance or use case.

In CCTP V2, each message specifies a `minFinalityThreshold`. This threshold
indicates the minimum level of confirmation required for Circle's attestation
service (Iris) to attest to the message. Iris will not attest to a message at a
confirmation level below the specified minimum threshold. This allows
applications to enforce a desired level of finality before acting on an
attestation on the destination chain.

### Defined Finality Thresholds

CCTP V2 defines the following finality thresholds:

| Finality Threshold | Value |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| **Confirmed**      | 1000  |
| **Finalized**      | 2000  |

### Messages and Finality

- Messages with a `minFinalityThreshold` of **1000** or lower are considered
  **Fast** messages. These messages are eligible for fast attestation at the
  _confirmed_ level by Iris.
- Messages with a `minFinalityThreshold` of **2000** are considered **Standard**
  messages. These messages are attested to at the _finalized_ level by Iris.

<Note>
Only two finality thresholds are supported. Any `minFinalityThreshold` value
below **1000** is treated as **1000**, and any value above **1000** is treated
as **2000**.
</Note>

## CCTP V2 Fees

For CCTP V2 transfers, a fee is collected onchain at the time of USDC minting.
Retrieve the applicable fee by calling the
[API](/api-reference/cctp/all/get-burn-usdc-fees) **every time** before
executing a transaction. Fees are subject to change with advance notice. See the
table below for rates.

- The `maxFee` parameter in `depositForBurn` specifies the maximum fee that can
  be charged during minting.
  - If `maxFee` is less than the minimum Standard Transfer fee, the burn reverts
    onchain.
  - If `maxFee` is equal to or greater than the minimum Fast Transfer fee and
    `minFinalityThreshold` is 1000 or lower, the attestation is eligible for
    Fast Transfer. In this case, the Fast Transfer fee (which varies by chain)
    is charged onchain at minting.
- If the attestation results in a Standard Transferâ€”for example, because
  `maxFee` is below the Fast Transfer fee or `minFinalityThreshold` is greater
  than 1000â€”the Standard Transfer fee is charged onchain at minting.

<Note>
The `minimumFee` field in the `/v2/burn/USDC/fees` response represents the
required fee rate in basis points (bps). To calculate the `maxFee` to include
in `depositForBurn`, multiply this value by the amount to be transferred.
</Note>

<Note>
**Note: Chains without Fast Transfer fees**

Some chains don't appear in the Fast Transfer fee table because their standard
attestation times are already very fast. Consequently, Fast Transfer is not
applicable when these chains are used as the source chain for burns.

Affected chains: **Avalanche**, **HyperEVM**, **Polygon PoS**, **Sei**,
**Sonic**, **XDC**.

### Standard Transfer Fee Switch

Some chains support a Standard Transfer fee switch, which enables enforcing a
minimum fee during a CCTP V2 Standard Transfer.

- Some deployments of the `TokenMessengerV2` contract include a fee switch that
  enforces a minimum onchain fee. This fee is collected during USDC minting in a
  Standard Transfer. See tables below for supported chains.
- `TokenMessengerV2` contracts with fee switch support include the
  `getMinFeeAmount` function, which calculates and returns the minimum fee
  required for a given burn amount, in units of the `burnToken`.

<Note>
**Important:**  
Calling `getMinFeeAmount` on a chain that uses an older `TokenMessengerV2`
contract (without fee switch support) will result in an error. Refer to the
tables below to determine which contract version is deployed on each EVM
chain.

## CCTP V2 Hooks

Hooks in CCTP V2 are metadata that can be attached to a burn message, allowing
integrators to execute custom logic at the destination chain. Hook execution is
left entirely to the integrator, offering maximum flexibility and enabling
broader cross-chain compatibility without altering the core CCTP protocol.

### Design overview

CCTP does not implement hook execution in the core protocol. Instead, hooks are
treated as opaque metadata passed along with the burn message. This design
allows integrators to define and control how hooks are processed on the
destination chain, based on their own infrastructure and trust model.

### Key benefits

- **Maximum flexibility for integrators**

  - Determine execution timing: pre-mint or post-mint
  - Implement custom recovery or error-handling strategies if hook execution
    fails
  - Choose any execution environment (EVM or non-EVM); even non-EVM chains can
    support Hooks as data passed into a function call.

- **Consistency with the `destinationCaller` pattern**

  - CCTP V2 continues the `destinationCaller` model from CCTP V1.
  - In most integrations, the `destinationCaller` is expected to handle hook
    execution, making it a natural extension of an existing pattern familiar to
    integrators.

- **Improved Compliance and Security Separation**
  - **Compliance**: By delegating hook execution to the integrator, the protocol
    maintains a clear boundary between CCTP's core message-passing functionality
    and application-specific logic. This modular approach helps integrators meet
    their own compliance requirements with greater flexibility.
  - **Security**: By keeping hook execution outside the core protocol, CCTP
    maintains a smaller and more focused security surface, while allowing
    integrators to manage their own execution environments independently.
