Before signing an attestation for a source chain event, Circle waits for a
specified number of onchain block confirmations to achieve
<Tooltip tip="The point at which a transaction is fully finalized on-chain and can no longer be reversed or reorganized. This ensures the highest level of security and certainty before attestation. Hard Finality requires the transaction to reach full consensus on the source blockchain, typically resulting in longer processing times.">hard finality</Tooltip>.

The tables below show the average time required for an attestation to become
available after fast and standard messages are emitted onchain, respectively.

<Note>
**Block confirmations for L2s to Ethereum**

Layer 2 (L2) blockchains publish transaction data in batches to Ethereum L1,
and the frequency of these posts varies by chain. Most OP Stack-based chains,
including Codex, post state updates using EIP-4844 blob transactions
approximately every ~15 minutes. After a batch is posted, Circle waits for the
Ethereum L1 block containing the batch to finalize, which typically happens
after \~65 blocks (13 to 19 minutes), before issuing an attestation.

**Hard finality for Linea**

The typical time before hard finality on Linea is 6-32 hours.

**Finality for Solana**

For Solana Standard Messages, Circle waits for block finality before
attesting. This takes 32 blocks. For Fast Messages, Circle only waits for the
block to be confirmed, meaning the block has received votes from validators
representing over two-thirds of the total stake. This typically takes 2-3
blocks.
