## Move money onchain

Use the Crypto Deposits and Crypto Payouts APIs to manage your Mint account.
These APIs let you build custom software that does Circle Mint actions.

- **Accept crypto deposits**: Accept USDC and EURC payments on supported
  blockchains.
- **Make crypto payouts**: Send fast, low-cost crypto payouts to your customers,
  vendors, and suppliers.

For more info about supported blockchains, see
[Deposits and Payouts APIs](/circle-mint/supported-chains-and-currencies#deposits-and-payouts-apis)
in Supported Chains and Currencies.

### Crypto Deposits API

With the Crypto Deposits API, you can take USDC and EURC payments directly
through onchain transfers.

[Read the quickstart guide on the Crypto Deposits API](/circle-mint/crypto-payments-quickstart).

### Crypto Payouts API

The Crypto Payouts API lets you send payouts to customers, vendors, or suppliers
directly using crypto.

You can fund payouts in USDC with your Circle Mint account. Your account can get
deposits from both traditional and blockchain payment systems.
