_Circle APIs support
[idempotent requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), which are a
type of request method that executes only once no matter how many times the
request is sent. Result: you can safely retry API calls when things go wrong
during a transaction (such as a network connection issue) before you receive a
response._

To ensure success, please note the following:

- To be sure a request is idempotent, you must generate and provide an
  idempotency key formatted as a GUID.
- Subsequent requests with the same idempotencyKey parameter value will produce
  the same result as the initial request.
- The `idempotencyKey` body parameter must be sent in
  [UUID format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).
