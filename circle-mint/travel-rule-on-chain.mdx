Avoid errors when performing $3000+ transfers by complying with the FinCEN Travel Rule.

Due to FinCEN guidance regarding transfers of $3,000 or more, Circle APIs may require you to share KYC information about the originator of the transaction to prevent the transfer from failing. According to FinCEN guidance regarding applicability of the Travel Rule to transfers of $3,000 or more (or matching cryptocurrency), the originating institution must transmit KYC information about the originator of a transaction to the beneficiary institution. Circle requires the sharing of this information for transfers made on the following blockchains:

* *Algorand (ALGO)*
* *Aptos (APTOS)*
* *Arbitrum (ARB)*
* *Avalanche (AVAX)*
* *Base (BASE)*
* *Celo (CELO)*
* *Ethereum (ETH)*
* *Near (NEAR)*
* *OP Mainnet (OP)*
* *Polygon (POLY)*
* *Ripple (XRPL)*
* *Solana (SOL)*
* *Stellar (XLM)*

For more information on these requirements and how data is securely collected
and shared, please see our
[FAQ](https://help.circle.com/s/search/%22Travel%20Rule%22).

## Sending Transfers (Non-Business Account)

When sending non-business account transfers on the aforementioned chains of
$3,000 in value or more, the originator’s identity will be required. If you are
sending a transfer on behalf of your end-user, you need to provide the identity
of your end-user. Otherwise, you need to provide your company’s identity.

In technical terms, the originator’s identity is required for
`POST /v1/transfers` when:

1. `destination.type: "blockchain"`
2. `destination.chain: "<aforementioned-blockchains>"`
3. `amount.amount` >= $3,000 in value

<Info>

If the `POST /v1/transfers` request requires an originator's identity and the
transfer does not contain an originator's identity, the transfer will fail.
You will receive a webhook notification with `data.status: fail`,
`riskEvaluation.decision: denied`, and `riskEvaluation.reason: 3220`.

</Info>

## Sending Transfers (Crypto Payouts)

When sending transfers on the aforementioned chains of $3,000 in value or more,
the originator’s identity will be required. If you are sending a payout on
behalf of someone else, you need to provide the identity of them. Otherwise, you
need to provide your company’s identity.

In technical terms, the originator’s identity is required for `POST /v1/payouts`
when:

1. `destination.type: "address_book"`
2. `amount.amount` >= $3,000 in value

<Info>

If the `POST /v1/payouts` request requires an originator's identity and the
transfer does not contain an originator's identity, the transfer will fail.

</Info>

## Sending Transfers (Business Account)

Although first-party transfers must comply with the Travel Rule, you do not need
to provide your company’s identity each time you make a business account
transfer `POST /v1/businessAccount/transfers`. Instead, Circle will use your
company’s identity stored on file and provide it to the receiving institution as
required.

## Receiving Transfers

If yours is a certain type of regulated financial institution, you are subject
to additional Travel Rule compliance requirements when receiving transfers. In
this case, we will provide you with the originator’s identity for webhook
notifications of type transfer in addition to `GET /v1/transfers` and
`GET /v1/transfers/{id}`. However, originator data will not be associated with a
transfer until it is marked with a status of complete.

* At this time, not all sending institutions are participating in the on-chain
  Travel Rule requirement. Therefore, not all transfers valued at $3,000 or more
  will have the originating person associated.
* If you are a financial institution and do not see the originator’s identity,
  please reach out to a Circle representative.

<Info>

Non-bank financial institutions will not see the originator’s identity for
received transfers.
