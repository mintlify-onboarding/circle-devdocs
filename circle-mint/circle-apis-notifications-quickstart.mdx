_Circle notifications will inform you every time the status of a resource
changes, such as changes in payment status. Notifications can be accessed by
setting up a notification subscriber endpoint on your end. This quickstart guide
shows how to set up notifications for the Circle APIs. Follow this to configure
a subscriber endpoint that sends a notification each time the resource status
changes._

Note: This guide addresses the payment resource, but is applicable to any of the
resources mentioned in
[Circle API Notifications](/circle-mint/notifications-data-models).

## 1. Expose a Subscriber Endpoint

To receive notifications on changes in resource status, you must expose a
publicly accessible subscriber endpoint on your side. The endpoint must handle
both `HEAD` and `POST` requests over HTTPS.

To expose an endpoint for testing, you can use
[webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to inspect, test and automate incoming
HTTPS requests or e-mails directly in the web browser.

<Note>
**ðŸ’¡ Tip:**

When you visit [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) for the first time, you
should see a status message that looks similar to the following:

`Your unique URL (Please copy it from here, not from the address bar!) https://webhook.site/83fa21a0-f00a-4673-bb50-bcf62c78b1f7`

</Note>

Navigate to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) and record the value of the
URL shown as `Your unique URL`:

<Frame>
  <img src="/circle-mint/images/nq-webhookurl01.png" />
</Frame>

In the example above, the unique URL
is:`https://webhook.site/83fa21a0-f00a-4673-bb50-bcf62c78b1f7`. Use the
public-facing URL you receive as you progress throughout this guide.

## 2. Subscribe to Status Notifications

Now that you have a publicly accessible endpoint, you need to register your
endpoint as a subscriber to webhook notifications by doing the following:

1. Navigate to **Developer > Subscriptions** in your Circle Mint account and
   click **Add Subscription**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/circle-mint/images/nq-subscription01.png" />
</Frame>

2. Enter your endpoint URL from above. It will be similar to the earlier
   example: `https://webhook.site/83fa21a0-f00a-4673-bb50-bcf62c78b1f7`.
3. Click **Add Subscription**:

</Frame>

4. You should receive two responses on your local server shell that confirm the
   subscription with a body similar to the following:

```json JSON
{
  "Type": "SubscriptionConfirmation",
  "MessageId": "ddbdcdcf-d36a-45b5-927c-da25b9b009ae",

}
```

<Note>
**Note:** The response body above is in a plain text format, so be sure you're
not expecting a JSON content type.
</Note>

5. To complete the subscription process, visit the `SubscribeURL` link in each
   response. Messages won't be sent to the endpoint until you confirm the
   subscription by accessing the URL.
6. After you visit the `SubscribeURL` links, the subscription status updates to
   `COMPLETE`, indicating it's ready for use.

<Note>
**Note:** In the Circle sandbox environment, if your subscription is stuck in
the `PENDING` (unconfirmed) state, reach out to
[customer-support@circle.com](mailto:customer-support@circle.com) to remove
it.

In the production environment, if your subscription is stuck in the `PENDING`
state, it's automatically removed after 72 hours.

You now have a sample local environment ready to receive notifications.
