## "Reorgs" and associated risks

Transactions in a blockchain are packaged into blocks. Different blockchains
have different rules for how to decide which transactions get packaged into a
block, but they often include rules for invalidating recently generated blocks.

This rewrite of history is called a "reorganization" ("reorg" for short) and
invalidates any transactions included in the invalidated blocks. You can think
of invalidated transactions that moved funds as transactions that "never
happened".

Such events can represent a security risk, because an attacker could use a
cryptocurrency transfer as payment for a good or service, and subsequently
trigger a reorg, thus invalidating his transfer (and getting his cryptocurrency
back) while keeping the good or service he paid for.

## Confirmations

To protect against reorg attacks, it's beneficial to wait for a number of
confirmed blocks before recognizing a transfer as final. As more blocks are
processed after a given block, the difficulty with which that block may be
invalidated increases. Therefore, by choosing how many blocks to wait before
recognizing a transfer, a receiver is able to balance speed (waiting very few
blocks in order to process the transfer quickly while taking on risk of losing
money due to a reorg) and security (waiting more blocks to minimize the risk of
a reorg at the cost of slower transfer processing).

The number of blocks you wait before considering a transfer as final is called
the "confirmation number", which is typically different for different chains.
Circle Mint and its APIs use the following confirmation numbers for each
supported chain. They are based on a variety of factors that Circle has
considered, including a given chain's historical performance, reorganizations,
and overall architecture, and they do not reflect the blockchain networks'
inherent requirements or limits.

| Chain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Confirmations/Blocks | Approximate Time  |

<Warning>
**Flow** (\*)

Effective Sept 3, 2024 - Circle is discontinuing support for USDC on Flow. For
details, see
[Circle is Discontinuing Support for USDC on the Flow (Cadence) blockchain](https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-is-discontinuing-support-for-usdc-on-flow-cadence-due-to-the-chains-upcoming-network-upgrade).

**TRON** (\*\*)

Effective Feb. 20, 2024 - Circle is discontinuing support for USDC on Tron.
Withdrawals deprecated. For details, see
[Circle is Discontinuing Support for USDC on the TRON blockchain](https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-is-discontinuing-support-for-usdc-on-the-tron-blockchain).

</Warning>

<Note>
**Linea and ZKsync**

Finality is reached approximately 65 Ethereum blocks after the proof for the
batch is posted to Ethereum L1.

**OP Stack Chains**

These Layer 2 (L2) rollup chains are built on the OP Stack and post periodic
batched transaction data to Layer 1 (L1) Ethereum for security. Circle
recognizes transaction finality on these networks only after the batch has
been submitted to Ethereum and received the required number of confirmations.
You can view transactions using L2 block explorers such as
[BaseScan](https://basescan.org) and
[Optimistic Etherscan](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/), even while Circle is
still processing finality.

**Hedera**

Hedera is built on a hashgraph rather than a blockchain. For this reason,
there isn't a count of confirmations/blocks before Circle determines the
transfer to be valid. Instead, this determination is performed on Hedera
directly and is then shared back to Circle. Please see the following link to
learn more about [Hedera consensus](https://hedera.com/how-it-works).

**Polygon PoS**

Circle's platform requires 50 confirmations for transactions on Polygon PoS
before marking them as complete, which takes ~2 minutes.

## Confirmations and transfer status

As soon as an incoming transfer is included in a block, the API will make it
available for you (whether you poll the
[get transfers endpoint](/api-reference/circle-mint/account/get-business-transfer)
or subscribe to notifications). However, the transfer will have a `running`
status and it will not credit the balance of the associated hosted wallet with
the transfer amount until the required number of confirmations has been reached.

At that point the transfer status will change to `completed`. If you have
subscribed to notifications, you will receive a message indicating such status
change.

You might want to deem an incoming transfer completed before such a status
change and fulfill your business process that depends on that transfer. But note
that you will be doing so at your own risk, as you might never actually receive
the funds in case there is a reorg before the number of confirmations has been
reached.

<Warning>

Please note that waiting for confirmations before crediting a wallet only
applies for on-chain transfers, where the `source` is of type `blockchain`.
Transfers between hosted wallets, where the `source` is of type `wallet` do not
require waiting on confirmations and are credited instantly.
