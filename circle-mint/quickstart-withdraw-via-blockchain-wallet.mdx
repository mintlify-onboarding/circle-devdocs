_Sending funds from your Circle Account to external blockchain wallets is one of
the most basic primitives (building blocks) enabled by the APIs. This quickstart
walks through sending USDC USD externally. You can follow the same steps when
sending EURC EUR as well._

## 1. Get an API key

Circle's APIs use [API keys](/circle-mint/api-keys) as the mechanism to
authenticate client requests. The API key must be set in the Authorization
header of the request sent from your backend server. The format of the header is
Bearer secret-key-value.  
To obtain an API key for the sandbox environment, create an account and generate
a new key in settings.

Once you have generated your API key, record it in a secure place.

## 2. Fund Your Account

If you haven't done so already, make sure you fund your account for testing. You
can do this one of two ways: by using the Circle Payments API to accept a
payment, or by receiving an external USDC transfer from a faucet or other
source.

## 3. Add Recipient Address

To send account funds externally, you need to allowlist a blockchain address to
send to (destination). Adding an external wallet address via the API requires
manual validation by an administrator. A notification to confirm the address is
sent to all administrators when the API call is made.

The sandbox environment uses the Ethereum Sepolia testing network, so the
destination blockchain address has to be a valid Sepolia address.

<Note>

USDC is available on testing networks on other blockchains as well. This guide
focuses on Ethereum but works similarly for other blockchains. For information
on other testing networks see
[Test USDC](/stablecoins/usdc-contract-addresses#testnet).

</Note>

<Warning>

**For France and Singapore customers**

Circle Mint France and Singapore customers must verify all transfer recipients
using the UI in the Circle Console, as transfers from unverified addresses will
be held in pending status. Please see Help Center articles below for details:

## 4. Send Funds

To keep things simple, we'll transfer funds to the deposit address of the USDC
faucet service on Sepolia. That address is
`0x493A9869E3B5f846f72267ab19B76e9bf99d51b1`.

<Warning>
**Balance Requirement**

You can transfer any amount you want, provided your account has sufficient
balance to cover the transfer. To send funds externally, you will use the create
account transfer endpoint.

</Warning>

<Note>
**Specify your blockchain**

Because Circle's APIs are designed for multiple chains and currencies, you must
specify the currency and chain you want to utilize. You can create a transfer by
using the command below.

</Note>

You can use the get transfer endpoint to retrieve details about the status of
the transaction. You can use it as in the command below.

    "status": "complete",
    "createDate": "2023-11-15T16:41:12.395Z"
  }
}
```

<Check>
**Notes about the process**

The first state transition for a transfer sets the `status` to `created` and the
`transactionHash` to `null`. At this point Circle has just started processing
the onchain send.

When Circle broadcasts the transfer a few seconds later, its `status` will
change to `running`. It will also display a `transactionHash` you can use to
track the transfer onchain, which you can look up on Etherscan's tracker on
Sepolia.

</Check>

Though not yet settled, you can consider the transaction complete because it has
been successfully broadcast to the network. Circle's systems will continue to
track the transfer until it has reached finality, at which point its status will
change to complete.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations. You have successfully sent cryptocurrency using Circle's
APIs.

## 6. Ready for the next step?

After experimenting with our APIs, youâ€™ll want to start building test
integrations in sandbox prior to moving into production. Start by applying for a
Circle Mint account. We'll be happy to walk you through the next steps.
