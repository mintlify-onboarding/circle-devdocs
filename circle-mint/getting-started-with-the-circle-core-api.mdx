The Core Functionality API allows you to manage your Circle Mint Account in a
programmatic way by automating the minting and redemption of USDC. Deposit
traditional money from 200+ countries and seamlessly convert it into
[digital currency dollars: USDC](/stablecoins/what-is-usdc). You can then use
USDC for everyday payments and treasury flows.

The Core Functionality API empowers you to do the following:

- Transfer USDC and EURC into your Circle Mint account across supported
  blockchains. See
  [Quickstart: Deposit via Blockchain Wallet](/circle-mint/quickstart-deposit-via-blockchain-wallet).

- Transfer USDC and EURC out of your Circle Mint account across supported
  blockchains. See
  [Quickstart: Withdraw via Blockchain Wallet](/circle-mint/quickstart-withdraw-via-blockchain-wallet).

- Make deposits from your business bank account to seamlessly convert
  traditional fiat into digital currency. See
  [Quickstart: Deposit via Funds Transfer](/circle-mint/quickstart-deposit-via-funds-transfer).

- Make withdrawals into your business bank account to seamlessly convert digital
  currency into traditional fiat. See
  [Quickstart: Withdraw to Bank](/circle-mint/quickstart-withdraw-via-blockchain-wallet).

## Additional APIs

Circle Mint customers can also access APIs for accepting crypto deposits and
sending crypto payouts. Please note these APIs are available at an additional
cost and require further solutioning with our team in order to best meet your
needs.
