Circle APIs are a set of functions and procedures that allow you to use USDC for
payments, payouts, and transfers. Circle's APIs are built around several
resources that represent payments, payouts, transfers, and their associated
objects.

## Primary resources

### Payout object

A `payout` object represents a payout to a customer, vendor, or supplier.

#### Example

```json

## Nested resources

The following are resources that are commonly used in other objects.

### Source and destination objects

Payments, payouts, and transfers reference `source` and `destination` objects,
which as the names suggest, tell you where the funds are coming from and where
they're going.

Sources and destinations can have the following types:

- `wire` for wire payments and payouts
- `blockchain` for transfers to/from blockchain addresses
- `wallet` for transfers to/from a Circle `wallet`

```json
// "blockchain"
// A "chain" and "address" together represent the blockchain location.
{
  "type": "blockchain",
  "address": "0x8381470ED67C3802402dbbFa0058E8871F017A6F",
  "chain": "ETH"
}

// "wallet"
// The "id" is the id of the Circle wallet.
{
  "type": "wallet",
  "id": "12345"
}
```

### Money object

Monetary amounts across Circle APIs are represented as `money` objects, which
consist of an `amount` and a `currency`. Two currencies are supported, `USD` and
`EUR`, with the amount represented as a string containing the whole units and
two decimals. In the example below, the amount is represented as 3.14 and the
currency as `USD`.

```json
{
  "amount": "3.14",
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Blockchain addresses

```json
{
  "address": "0x8381470ED67C3802402dbbFa0058E8871F017A6F",
  "currency": "USD",
  "chain": "ETH"
}
```
