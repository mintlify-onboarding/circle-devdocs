The Crypto Payouts API allows you to send USDC and EURC. To use the Crypto
Payouts API, you should add the recipient blockchain address to the Address Book
directory before using that address to perform an onchain send.

This guide walks you through how to create an active recipient, create a payout
to that recipient, and verify that the payout completed successfully.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this quickstart, ensure that you have:

- Obtained an API key for Mint from Circle
- Obtained access to the Crypto Payouts API
- Installed cURL on your development machine
- (Optional) configured a webhook notification endpoint

This quickstart provides API requests in cURL format, along with example
responses.

## Part 1: Create an active recipient

Before sending a payout, you must first create a recipient your Mint address
book. Depending on your Mint configuration, new recipients may either be active
immediately or inactive for the first 24 hours.

<Note>
**Note:** You have the option to turn on delayed withdrawals in the Circle
Mint console. When turned on, all new addresses are inactive for the first 24
hours, during which you can't make a payout. When turned off, all new
addresses are available for payouts immediately.
</Note>

### 1.1. Add a recipient to your address book

The
[`/v1/addressBook/recipients`](/api-reference/circle-mint/payouts/create-address-book-recipient)
endpoint creates a new recipient address in your Mint address book. Use the
following example request to create a new recipient.

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://api-sandbox.circle.com/v1/addressBook/recipients' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'X-Request-Id: fb7980ad-fd01-468b-98ff-2d9ecff67f86' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "idempotencyKey": "9352ec9e-5ee6-441f-ab42-186bc71fbdde",
  "chain": "ETH",
  "address": "0x65BFCf1a6289a0b77b4D3F7d12005a05949FD8C3",
  "metadata": {
    "email": "satoshi@circle.com",
    "bns": "testbns",
    "nickname": "test nickname desc"
  }
}'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "dff5fcb3-2e52-5c13-8a66-0a5be9c7ecbe",
    "chain": "ETH",
    "address": "0x65bfcf1a6289a0b77b4d3f7d12005a05949fd8c3",
    "metadata": {
      "nickname": "test nickname desc",
      "email": "satoshi@circle.com",
      "bns": "testbns"
    },
    "status": "pending",
    "updateDate": "2022-09-22T14:16:34.985353Z",
    "createDate": "2022-09-22T14:16:34.985353Z"
  }
}
```

### 1.2. Check recipient status

Prior to sending the payout you must ensure the recipient is active. You can't
send a payout to an inactive recipient. You can check if the recipient is active
through the API in two ways:
[webhook notifications](#121-webhook-notifications-optional) or
[polling the endpoint](#122-polling).

If you have turned on delayed withdrawals, you should set up one of these
methods to check when the new recipient changes status from `inactive` to
`active`. If you have turned off inactive withdrawals, you should use the
[polling](#122-polling) example to verify that the recipient is in the active
state on creation.

You should not continue this guide until you've verified the new recipient is in
the `active` state.

#### 1.2.1. Webhook notifications (optional)

Webhook notifications allow you to receive updates from Mint on events on your
account. If configured, you'll receive updates when address book recipients are
created or change status. An example notification showing the recipient status
change is shown below.

```json
{
  "clientId": "a03a47ff-b0eb-4070-b3df-dc66752cc802",
  "notificationType": "addressBookRecipients",
  "version": 1,
  "customAttributes": {
    "clientId": "a03a47ff-b0eb-4070-b3df-dc66752cc802"
  },
  "addressBookRecipient": {
    "id": "dff5fcb3-2e52-5c13-8a66-0a5be9c7ecbe",
    "chain": "ETH",
    "address": "0x65bfcf1a6289a0b77b4d3f7d12005a05949fd8c3",
    "metadata": {
      "nickname": "test nickname desc",
      "email": "satoshi@circle.com",
      "bns": "testbns"
    },
    "status": "active",
    "updateDate": "2022-09-22T14:16:34.985353Z",
    "createDate": "2022-09-22T14:16:34.985353Z"
  }
}
```

#### 1.2.2. Polling

If you don't have webhook notifications set up, or you have delayed withdrawals
turned off, you can poll the
[`/v1/addressBook/recipients/{id}`](/api-reference/circle-mint/payouts/get-address-book-recipient)
endpoint until the response contains the `"status": "active"` parameter.

Polling consists of calling the endpoint on a regular interval until the desired
response is returned. The following example is a manual request to the endpoint:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api-sandbox.circle.com/v1/addressBook/recipients/dff5fcb3-2e52-5c13-8a66-0a5be9c7ecbe' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'X-Request-Id: 55990729-c59f-4cda-9edd-838cefaa1e42' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "dff5fcb3-2e52-5c13-8a66-0a5be9c7ecbe",
    "chain": "ETH",
    "address": "0x65bfcf1a6289a0b77b4d3f7d12005a05949fd8c3",
    "metadata": {
      "nickname": "test nickname desc",
      "email": "satoshi@circle.com",
      "bns": "testbns"
    },
    "status": "active",
    "updateDate": "2022-09-22T14:16:34.985353Z",
    "createDate": "2022-09-22T14:16:34.985353Z"
  }
}
```

## Part 2: Create a payout

Once you have successfully created a recipient, create a payout using the
[`/v1/payouts`](/api-reference/circle-mint/payouts/create-payout) endpoint. The
request should include the recipient address ID, originating funds, and the
currency the recipient would like to receive.

<Warning>

If `toAmount.currency` is not provided, `amount.currency` is used as receiving
currency.

The `source.identities` object is required for payouts >= $3,000. The object
refers to the organization sending the funds, not the recipient. This is to
ensure compliance with the FINCEN
[Travel Rule](/circle-mint/travel-rule-on-chain).

</Warning>

Use the following command to create a payout:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://api-sandbox.circle.com/v1/payouts' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'X-Request-Id: ff422eab-52fa-4a6e-bf07-b6b522786468' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "idempotencyKey": "ba943ff1-ca16-49b2-ba55-1057e70ca5c7",
  "source": {
    "type": "wallet",
    "id": "12345",
    "identities": [
    {
      "type": "individual",
      "name": "Satoshi Nakamoto",
      "addresses": [
        {
          "line1": "100 Money Street",
          "line2": "Suite 1",
          "city": "Boston",
          "district": "MA",
          "postalCode": "01234",
          "country": "US"
        }
      ]
    }
   ]
  },
  "destination": {
    "type": "address_book",
    "id": "dff5fcb3-2e52-5c13-8a66-0a5be9c7ecbe",
  },
  "amount": {
    "amount": "3000.14",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "toAmount": {
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "b8627ae8-732b-4d25-b947-1df8f4007a29",
    "sourceWalletId": "12345",
    "destination": {
      "type": "address_book",
      "id": "b8627ae8-732b-4d25-b947-1df8f4007a29"
    },
    "amount": {
      "amount": "3000.14",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "toAmount": {
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "status": "pending",
    "updateDate": "2020-04-10T02:13:30.000Z",
    "createDate": "2020-04-10T02:13:30.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Part 3: Check payout status

As a best practice, you should always check that the funds were sent and
delivered onchain.

### 3.1. Webhook notifications (optional)

If you have configured webhook notifications you'll receive a notification for
each payout status update. The following is an example notification:

```json
{
  "clientId": "a03a47ff-b0eb-4070-b3df-dc66752cc802",
  "notificationType": "payout",
  "version": 1,
  "customAttributes": {
    "clientId": "a03a47ff-b0eb-4070-b3df-dc66752cc802"
  },
  "payout": {
    "id": "b8627ae8-732b-4d25-b947-1df8f4007a29",
    "sourceWalletId": "12345",
    "destination": {
      "type": "address_book",
      "id": "b8627ae8-732b-4d25-b947-1df8f4007a29"
    },
    "amount": {
      "amount": "3000.14",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "toAmount": {
      "amount": "3000.14",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "fees": {
      "amount": "0.00",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "networkFees": {
      "amount": "0.30",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "status": "complete",
    "createDate": "2020-04-10T02:13:30.000Z",
    "updateDate": "2020-04-10T02:13:30.000Z"
  }
}
```

### 3.2: Polling (optional)

If you don't have webhook notifications set up you can poll the
[`/v1/payouts/{id}`](/api-reference/circle-mint/payouts/get-payout) endpoint
until the response contains the `"status": "complete"` parameter.

Polling consists of calling the endpoint on a regular interval until the desired
response is returned. The following example is a manual request to the endpoint:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api-sandbox.circle.com/v1/payouts/b8627ae8-732b-4d25-b947-1df8f4007a29' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'X-Request-Id: d36f3c00-9c98-4610-bfea-83995379995e' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "2f3bca9a-2d0e-4aef-a511-026eefd3cc6f",
    "destination": {
      "type": "address_book",
      "id": "eaca84eb-69fb-53d3-9dac-f69cb5f1541a"
    },
    "amount": {
      "amount": "500.00",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "toAmount": {
      "amount": "500.00",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "externalRef": "0x41f8f2cd555e247716f3e9bc97366ac04a848fd2fde76732c894c6843fc6f8db",
    "createDate": "2023-08-14T20:30:19.145913Z",
    "updateDate": "2023-08-14T22:05:55.406292Z",
    "sourceWalletId": "1000594146",
    "fees": {
      "amount": "1.00",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "networkFees": {
      "amount": "0.01",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "status": "complete"
  }
}
```
