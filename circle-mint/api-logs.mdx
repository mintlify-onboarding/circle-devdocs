_[API Logs](https://app-sandbox.circle.com/developer/logs) are transaction logs
that enable you to view your API transaction history and debug API errors with
no setup required. They show the most accurate representation of what Circle
received and sent. When you send an API request, Circle stores it along with its
associated response. On the API logs page, you can view these API logs for seven
days after the request is sent and filter them to find the specific request you
are looking for. You can use the API logs to debug API errors without having to
log out of your system._

- To access the logs, go to [Circle Sandbox](https://app-sandbox.circle.com) or
  [Circle Mint](https://app.circle.com) and click the **Developer Tab > Logs**.

## Data Redaction

Due to the sensitivity of some data provided to Circle, including financial
payment methods and PII data, some values will be redacted from the request and
response payloads. Values that are redacted are replaced with the value
`“[redacted].”` If you need access to this sensitive data, reach out to your
Circle customer success manager.
