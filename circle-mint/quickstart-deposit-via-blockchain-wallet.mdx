_This quickstart walks through sending USDC or EURC on any of the supported
blockchain from a wallet to your Circle Mint Account._

## 1. Get an API key

Circle's APIs use [API keys](/circle-mint/api-keys) as the mechanism to
authenticate client requests. The API key must be set in the Authorization
header of the request sent from your backend server. The format of the header is
Bearer secret-key-value.

To obtain an API key for the sandbox environment, simply
[create an account](https://app.circle.com/get-started/create-account) and
generate a new key in settings - it only takes a few seconds.

[GET AN API KEY](https://app-sandbox.circle.com/)

Once you have generated your API key, record it in a secure place.

## 2. Create a deposit address

To send funds to your Circle Mint Account on-chain, you will first need to
generate a deposit address. To that end, you can use the
[create a deposit address](/api-reference/circle-mint/account/create-business-deposit-address)
API endpoint.

**Request**:

```curl Curl
curl --request POST \\

--url https\://api-sandbox.circle.com/v1/businessAccount/wallets/addresses/deposit \\
--header 'accept: application/json' \\
--header 'authorization: Bearer SAND\_API\_KEY:' \\
--header 'content-type: application/json' \\
--data '

{
"currency": "USD",
"chain": "BASE"
}
'
```

{/* <!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 --> */}

**Response**

```json JSON
{
  "data": {
    "id": "d51d72d2-9955-4340-b3fd-2f07a82a1e6c",
    "address": "0xbd01242af414961c25aa72dcae06646fc52e9b92",
    "currency": "USD",
    "chain": "BASE"
  }
}
```

{/* <!-- markdownlint-enable 036--> */}

<Note>
**Note**: You can only create one deposit address per blockchain.
</Note>

## 3. List all deposit addresses

Each blockchain will have its own deposit address and it is important to ensure
you always use the correct address. You can always make a GET request to see all
of your different deposit addresses.

In the following example make substitutions for the following placeholder keys:

- Replace `${YOUR\_API\_KEY}` with your API key.
- Replace `${TRANSFER\_ID}` with the ID of the transfer you created earlier.

```curl Curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR\_API\_KEY}" \\

-X GET https\://api-sandbox.circle.com/v1/businessAccount/wallets/addresses/deposit
```

The Get Transfer response should look similar to the following:

```json JSON
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "d51d72d2-9955-4340-b3fd-2f07a82a1e6c",
      "address": "0xbd01242af414961c25aa72dcae06646fc52e9b92",
      "currency": "USD",
      "chain": "BASE"
    },
    {
      "id": "50f79198-4af9-466f-a235-c277d1643403",
      "address": "0xbd01242af414961c25aa72dcae06646fc52e9b92",
      "currency": "USD",
      "chain": "ARB"
    },
    {
      "id": "6d2c6c1a-91a0-49f9-b997-ce78fc9cdc3d",
      "address": "0xbd01242af414961c25aa72dcae06646fc52e9b92",
      "currency": "USD",
      "chain": "ETH"
    },
    {
      "id": "4f8489e4-e039-5e2c-ba6f-078c190dbfbc",
      "address": "0xbd01242af414961c25aa72dcae06646fc52e9b92",
      "currency": "USD",
      "chain": "MATIC"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Deposit to your account

Blockchain deposits can only be initiated from your respective wallet so this
part of the deposit process will take place outside of Circleâ€™s API.

Using the wallet address returned in the previous step, you will send funds from
your blockchain wallet to your Circle Mint Account.

<Warning>
  **Warning**: You must confirm the blockchain network is consistent with the
  address you requested from Circle and the wallet youâ€™re using to make this
  transfer, or you could lose funds.
</Warning>

## 5. Check the latest balance

You can use the
[list all balances](/api-reference/circle-mint/account/list-business-balances)
API endpoint to retrieve the balance of funds available for use in your account.

In the following example make substitutions for the following placeholder keys:

- Replace `${YOUR\_API\_KEY}`with your API key.
- Replace `${TRANSFER\_ID}` with the ID of the transfer you created earlier.

```curl Curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${YOUR\_API\_KEY}" \\

-X GET https\://api-sandbox.circle.com/v1/businessAccount/balances
```

The response should look similar to the following: this:

```json JSON
{
  "data": {
    "available": [
      {
        "amount": "17460.00",
        "currency": "USD"
      }
    ],
    "unsettled": []
  }
}
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations. You have successfully deposited cryptocurrency from your
external blockchain wallet to your Circle Mint Account.

## 6. Ready for the next step?

After experimenting with our APIs, youâ€™ll be better prepared to start building
test integrations in sandbox, prior to moving into production. Start by
[applying for a Circle Mint account](https://www.circle.com/en/circle-mint).
We'll be happy to walk you through the next steps.
