_If you've completed your API integration in Circle’s sandbox, it's time to move
your site into production. Because the code is largely the same between sandbox
and production, moving into the production environment is a fairly
straightforward process. Follow the steps below and take note of any additional
information provided._

To ensure success, please note the following:

- If you have any questions about the differences listed below, reach out to
  your Circle solutions engineer or our
  [customer support team](mailto:customer-support@circle.com) for more
  information.
- Note that to obtain Production API keys, you need to apply for a
  [Circle Mint account](https://www.circle.com/en/circle-mint).

## 1. Move your code to production

Take your sandbox code into the production environment. There are a couple ways
to do this based on your needs:

- **Basic users** who only need Circle's core functionality can use the same
  code documents they've been using in sandbox and convert them directly into
  production code using the steps below.
- **Advanced users** using our full suite of APIs will probably want to continue
  using the sandbox version of their site in parallel for continued development,
  testing, and troubleshooting. These users should clone their sandbox code and
  edit the copy to bring it into production.

## 2. Replace sandbox URLs with production URLs

When you're transitioning from Sandbox to Production, you'll need to switch to
the Production base URL for your requests.

Sandbox URL: `https://api-sandbox.circle.com`  
Production URL: `https://api.circle.com`

In some cases, this will be as simple as performing a “find and replace”
function with a text editor; in others it will be more complex depending on your
approach. Consult your engineering team if you have any questions.

## 3. Replace sandbox API keys with production API keys

Now that you're ready to move to production, navigate to the API key tab within
the Circle Mint developer dashboard. Create an API key and name it, and assign
it a list of IPs permitted to originate requests. After creating your API key,
you can copy and paste it as needed.

**Security:** _Because the production API key allows you to work with real, live
funds within your Circle Mint account, the key must be provided and managed by
Circle. (You can't regenerate it from your Circle Mint account.) For this
reason, your production API key must be treated with appropriate security
protocols. Please consult your company's security team if you have questions._

<Note>
  Circle disables public access to all APIs by default. If you haven’t already
  connected with a Circle representative regarding using Circle's APIs, please
  reach out to
  [customer-support@circle.com](mailto:customer-support@circle.com).
</Note>

## 4. (Optional) Set up your system to originate requests from IPv4 addresses allowlist

If you have set up an IP allowlist, Circle only accepts requests using your
Production API key that originate from an IP address on the list.

- **Set up your system** to send production calls only from these addresses.
- **Double-check** that these static addresses match the ones you sent to
  Circle.

## 5. Check that your API Key Roles are up to date

While working in sandbox, your sandbox API key has allowed you to make calls to
any Circle endpoint for testing purposes. In production, you’ll be restricted to
the functionality—and endpoint access—that you are specifically solutioned for
in your Solution Description and Flow of Funds documents. If you attempt to make
API calls to an endpoint you aren’t solutioned for, you’ll receive a 403
response.

- **Test your calls.** Try out each of the API calls you created in sandbox to
  make sure that they still work in production. For instance, your
  [list all balances](/api-reference/circle-mint/account/list-business-balances)
  call from sandbox should still provide balances in production as long as you
  have updated the URL.
- **Update as necessary.** If you run into error codes, or if your needs have
  changed and you need additional functionality, contact your Circle
  representative. They can update your Solution Description and Flow of Funds
  agreements to enable the needed functionality.

## 6. Allow for actual production settlement times

In the sandbox environment, settlement times (the time it takes to process a
transaction) are kept as low as possible to enable you to easily test a variety
of behaviors. Because they reflect real-world transactions, production
settlement times will invariably be longer (see table below).

- **Test actual settlement times** in production.
- **Take into account** your own operations and whether you want to perform
  certain actions (such as releasing goods) after confirmation or after
  settlement.
- **Update your interface** to manage users’ expectations.

### Crypto Payments and Payouts

- See [blockchain confirmations](/circle-mint/blockchain-confirmations).

## 7. Anticipate transaction fees

Because sandbox does not reflect your client agreement with Circle, fees in the
sandbox environment may not always reflect the fees you’ll be charged in
production.

- **See your contract with Circle** to understand what fees you’ll see when you
  initiate transactions in the production environment.
- **Determine actual fees** by testing various transactions in production.
- **Update your interface** if you will be passing along these fees to your
  customers.
