_API keys are unique data strings used to authenticate a user and enable access
to privileged operations on Circle APIs. All Circle APIs use API keys as the
mechanism to [authenticate](/circle-mint/authentication) client requests. Your
API key should be kept confidential and secure at all times._

- Authentication is required for all API requests; without it, the requests will
  fail.
- All API requests must be made over HTTPS.

<Warning>
**Keep Your API Keys Safe**

Because our API keys allow access to privileged operations on Circle APIs, you
must keep them secure at all times.

- Ensure your API key is always stored securely.
- Never share it or record it in a publicly accessible medium (client-side code,
  public repositories, etc.).

**Caution:** If you lose secure control of your API keys, your entity may suffer
financial loss.

</Warning>

## Manage Your API keys

Use the Developer Dashboard to access and manage the API keys for your entity.
Go to the Circle Mint developer dashboard and click on the API Keys tab to
create, view, edit, and revoke API keys. You must be logged into the production
or sandbox Developer Dashboard and be an Administrator to access the API keys
page:

- Production: `https://app.circle.com/developer`
- Sandbox: `https://app-sandbox.circle.com/developer`

**Note:** By default, Circle disables all product APIs in Production. Please see
[Circle APIs: Sandbox to Production Transition Guide](/circle-mint/sandbox-to-production-transition-guide)
for more instructions on how to enable access to product APIs.

## Types of API keys

Circle API supports two types of API keys:

- **Standard** keys provide the permissions to use any of Circle APIs for which
  your entity has subscribed service.
- **Restricted** keys limit access to the product role you select during key
  generation.

<Warning>
  It is possible to create keys in the Developer Dashboard before you gain
  business access to the endpoints for that product. As such, you may have
  access to a valid key that is scoped to product APIs your entity is not
  authorized to use. Requests to API endpoints for which you are not enabled
  return a `401: Unauthorized` HTTP status code. In that event, contact your
  Circle Support Engineer to verify product access for your entity.
</Warning>
