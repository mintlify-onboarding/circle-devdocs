_Circle’s sandbox environment is a development tool that allows you to safely
test prototypes and integration without generating actual financial
transactions. Sandbox APIs match those in production, making it easy to move
into the production phase._

## Safe Development

The sandbox environment is perfect for prototyping and integration testing. The
APIs on sandbox respond authentically to your requests without connecting to the
live Circle backend.

## Easy Transitions

The sandbox APIs align perfectly with those in production. Once you’ve perfected
your code in the sandbox environment, you can simply replace the sandbox
endpoints with the production ones to create working code.

## Simulated Transactions

The APIs on sandbox do not actually charge payment methods or manipulate actual
money or USDC. The sandbox environment connects safely to
[USDC using test networks only](/stablecoins/usdc-contract-addresses#testnet).

## API Environments and Hosts

Use these hosts to access APIs on sandbox and production environments.

| Environment | API host                         |
| :---------- | :------------------------------- |
| Sandbox     | `https://api-sandbox.circle.com` |
| Production  | `https://api.circle.com`         |
