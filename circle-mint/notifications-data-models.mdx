Circle API notifications are subscriber endpoints that enable you to receive
notifications every time the status of a resource changes.

## Common attributes

All notification messages have the following attributes:

| Name               | Type              | Description                   | Sample                                 |
| :----------------- | :---------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `clientId`         | `string` (UUIDv4) | Client identifier             | `c60d2d5b-203c-45bb-9f6e-93641d40a599` |
| `notificationType` | `string`          | The type of notification      | `payouts`                              |
| `version`          | `int`             | The version of the data model | `1`                                    |

## Implementations

This section lists all notification models.

### Payout

#### Completed

_Completed_ payouts are settled payouts. Therefore, the funds should be
available in the destination wallet. The following structure represents the
notifications for completed payouts.

```json Completed Payout Notification Payload
{
   "clientId": "c60d2d5b-203c-45bb-9f6e-93641d40a599",
   "notificationType": "payouts",
   "payout": {...}
}
```

The `payout` payload is a
[payout object](/circle-mint/circle-api-resources#payout-object).

#### Failed

Failed payouts notifications are structured as follows:

```json Failed Payout Notification Payload
{
   "clientId": "c60d2d5b-203c-45bb-9f6e-93641d40a599",
   "notificationType": "payouts",
   "payout": {...}
}
```

The `payout` payload is a
[payout object](/circle-mint/circle-api-resources#payout-object).

### Transfer

#### Created

A notification with the structure below is sent on transfer creation.

```json Created Transfer Notification Payload
{
   "clientId": "c60d2d5b-203c-45bb-9f6e-93641d40a599",
   "notificationType": "transfers",
   "transfer": {...}
}
```

The `transfer` payload is a
[transfer object](/circle-mint/circle-api-resources#transfer-object).

#### Failed

Failed transfers notifications are structured as follows:

```json Failed Transfer Notification Payload
{
   "clientId": "c60d2d5b-203c-45bb-9f6e-93641d40a599",
   "notificationType": "transfers",
   "transfer": {...}
}
```

The `transfer` payload is a
[transfer object](/circle-mint/circle-api-resources#transfer-object).

#### Completed

Completed transfers notifications are structured as follows:

```json Completed Transfer Notification Payload
{
   "clientId": "c60d2d5b-203c-45bb-9f6e-93641d40a599",
   "notificationType": "transfers",
   "transfer": {...}
}
```

The `transfer` payload is a
