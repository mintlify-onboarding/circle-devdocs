Use the Python SDK to interact with Circle's Developer-Controlled Wallet APIs,
which allow you to embed secure wallets in your applications and create
blockchain transactions using the Developer Services platform.

This page provides short examples of how to install and use the
developer-controlled wallets SDK. For complete examples, see the
[Sample Projects](/sample-projects) page. For more information see the
[developer-controlled wallets documentation](/wallets/dev-controlled).

## Prerequisites

- Have Python installed.
- Have an active [Circle Developer Account](https://console.circle.com/).
- [Generate an API key](https://developers.circle.com/w3s/web3-services-api-client-keys-auth)
  to use in requests to the Circle API.
- [Generate an entity secret](https://developers.circle.com/wallets/dev-controlled/register-entity-secret)
  to use in requests with the developer-controlled wallets SDK.

Although not a requirement for using the SDK, Circle recommends that you
[use a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
for development. A Python virtual environment is an isolated environment that
you can use to silo your project from the global Python environment.

## Install the SDK

Use the following command to install the SDK with
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```shell
pip install circle-developer-controlled-wallets
```

## Developer-controlled wallets client

To start using the SDK, you first need to configure a client and initialize it
with your API key and entity secret.

### Import the client

The following example shows how to import the client and configure it to use
your API key and entity secret:

```python
from circle.web3 import utils

client = utils.init_developer_controlled_wallets_client(
  api_key="Your API KEY",
  entity_secret="Your entity secret"
)
```

### Create a wallet

The following example shows how to create a wallet using the client:

```python
from circle.web3 import developer_controlled_wallets

api_instance = developer_controlled_wallets.WalletSetsApi(client)

# create wallet sets
try:
    request = developer_controlled_wallets.CreateWalletSetRequest.from_dict({
        "name": "my_wallet_set"
    })
    api_instance.create_wallet_set(request)
except developer_controlled_wallets.ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling WalletSetsApi->create_wallet_set: %s\n" % e)

# get wallet sets
try:
    response = api_instance.get_wallet_sets()
    for wallet_set in response.data.wallet_sets:
        print(wallet_set.actual_instance.id)
except developer_controlled_wallets.ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling WalletSetsApi->get_wallet_sets: %s\n" % e)
```

## Client configuration options

The client for the developer-controlled wallets SDK accepts the following
configuration parameters:

| **Option**      | **Required?** | **Description**                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api_key`       | Yes           | The API key used to authenticate requests to the Circle API.                                    |
| `entity_secret` | Yes           | Your configured entity secret.                                                                  |
| `host`          | No            | The base URL that overrides the default API URL of `https://api.circle.com/v1/w3s`.             |
| `user_agent`    | No            | Custom user agent request header. If provided, it's added before the default user agent header. |
