Circle's Smart Contract Templates make it easy to integrate smart contracts into
your application without writing Solidity code. Deploy contracts in minutes
using our curated and audited templates, which support popular on-chain use
cases. You can deploy these templates through the console or APIs.

## Quick Start Guide

This guide will show you how to deploy an ERC-721 contract using Circle's NFT
template.

Yo'll learn to use both the Developer Services Console and API paths. The
console is ideal for beginners to explore and understand contract functions.

## Evaluate Templates

To learn more about the NFT template or any other template, go to the
[Developer Services Console](/w3s/circle-developer-account) or the
[Templates Glossary](/contracts/scp-templates-overview) guide.

- **Developer Services Console:** Viewing templates from the console provides a
  simple way to understand the contracts offered, what they are, the primary use
  cases each supports, the contracts' ABI functions, events, and code.
- **Template Glossary:** Outlines the templates offered, a summary of each one,
  and the configuration options for deployment.

## Select Your Preferred Approach

1. **[Console Path:](/contracts/deploy-smart-contract-template#console-ui-path)**
   Use the Developer Services Console and a console wallet to deploy a smart
   contract template and mint an NFT. This UI option is the preferred method for
   those new to using Smart Contracts. It is faster and has much fewer
   prerequisite steps.
2. **[API Path:](/contracts/deploy-smart-contract-template#api-path)** Use APIs
   to deploy a smart contract template and mint an NFT. This option is more
   technical and requires creating an API key and a Developer-Controlled wallet.

## Console UI Path

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [Developer Account](/w3s/circle-developer-account).

## Console Wallets

Console Wallets are Smart Contract Accounts specifically designed to be used
within the Console and cannot be utilized with the APIs. Console Wallets
leverage Gas Station, eliminating the need to maintain gas in the wallet to
cover transaction fees. To learn more about the Gas Station, please refer to the
[Gas Station](/wallets/gas-station) overview.

If you do not already have a Console Wallet, you will be prompted to create one
during the deployment of your first smart contract.

<Warning>
**Console Wallet Deploy Cost**

Unlike Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), SCAs cost gas to “deploy”. With our
process of lazy deployment, you won't have to pay the gas fee at the time of
wallet creation. Instead, the fee will be charged when you initiate your first
outbound transaction.

</Warning>

## 1. Deploy the Smart Contract

In the [console](https://console.circle.com):

1. Navigate to the **Templates** tab via the left navigation.
2. Select **NFT** ERC-721**.**
3. Fill in the contract template deployment parameters:

   1. **Name**: The off-chain name of the contract. This will only be
      represented on Circle's systems, such as the APIs and Developer Services
      Console. In this case, you can use “My First NFT Contract” or any other
      name you prefer.

   2. **Contract Name:** The on-chain name for the contract. In this case, you
      can use “My First NFT Contract” or any other name you prefer.

   3. **Default Admin:** The address of the default admin. This address can
      execute permissions functions on the contract. This should be an address
      you control or the address of a user if deploying on their behalf. In this
      case, use the console wallet's address from step one.

      1. NOTE: The following roles will be given to the defaultAdmin:
         `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `MINTER_ROLE`, `TRANSFER_ROLE`. The
         `defaultAdmin` will also be set as the contract's owner. All of these
         roles can be updated by the defaultAdmin later.

   4. **Primary Sale Recipient:** The recipient's address for first-time sales.
      All first-time sale proceeds will go to this address. In this case, use
      the console wallet's address from step one.

   5. **Royalty Recipient:** The recipient address for all royalties. Any
      proceeds from secondary sales will go to this address. In this case, use
      the console wallet's address from step one.

   6. **Royalty Percent:** The percentage of secondary sales that go to the
      royalty recipient. There should be a value between 0 and 100. In this
      case, use “0”.

   7. **Network**: The network to deploy onto. In this case, select “Polygon
      Amoy”.

   8. **Select Wallet:** The wallet to deploy the smart contract from. In this
      case, select “Console Wallet 1”

   9. **Deployment Speed**: A fee level setting (FAST, AVERAGE, SLOW). This
      affects how quickly the network will process your deployment transaction.
      In this case, you will use “AVERAGE”.

4. Select **Deploy**.

<br />

<br />

<Note>
**Console Wallet Creation**

After selecting a network, you will prompted to create a Console Wallet for
deployment. This wallet will automatically be created on all available
networks. On testnet, this will also automatically create a Policy for Gas
Station. For more information on sponsoring transactions, see
[Gas Station Policy Management](/wallets/gas-station/policy-management) .

<Frame>

</Frame>
</Note>



<br />

<br />

Once deployed, you will be placed back on the **Contracts** dashboard. Here, you
can check the deployment status of the contract. When you land on the page,
expect the deployment status to be **Pending**. Give it several seconds, and
then refresh the page. At this point, the deployment status should be set to
**Complete**.

<br />

<br />

<br />

## 2. Mint an NFT

Let's dive into the Console UI to explore the full range of capabilities it
offers and mint an NFT. With the Console, you can seamlessly explore the NFT
contract you deployed. Gain insights into its ABI functions, inspect their
inputs, and easily execute functions. In this example, we will directly execute
the mintTo function from the console - which mints an NFT to a user without a
sale.

In the [console](https://console.circle.com):

1. Navigate to the **Contracts** tab.

2. Select the **My First NFT Contract** within the console.

3. Select **ABI Functions** sub tab. This should be selected by default.

4. Select **Write**.

5. Select **mintTo**.

6. On the **mintTo** ABI function, provide the following parameters:

   1. **\_to:** The wallet address to which the NFT will be minted. In this
      case, use the wallet address of the wallet you deployed the contract from.
      Ultimately, this can be any wallet on-chain.
   2. **\_uri:** A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset.
      This can be a IPFS CID, a CDN URI or any other resource identifier.

7. Select **Execute Function** and ensure **Console Wallet 1** is selected.

8. Select **Execute.**

<Frame>
  <img src="/w3s/images/scp-dnftsc-consolemint01.png" />
</Frame>

Once executed, select **View Transaction History** to access the Console
Wallet's transaction dashboard. Here, you can easily monitor the progress and
status of the transaction. Once the transaction state is marked as **Complete**,
the NFT has been successfully transferred on-chain to the designated address
mentioned above.

<Note>
**Inbound Transaction**

In the transaction history view, you will also notice an inbound transfer
indicating that the NFT has been minted to the Console Wallet.
</Note>

Congratulations, you have deployed a smart contract and minted an NFT! As a next
step, you may want to:

1. Learn how to mint NFTs via the
   [API](/contracts/deploy-smart-contract-template#api-path).
2. Deploy a Token or Multi-Token contract.

## API Path

## Prerequisites

1. Create a Developer Account, API key, and set up a Developer-Controlled
   Wallet. We recommend using our
   [interactive quickstart guide](/interactive-quickstarts/dev-controlled-wallets)
   to complete these requirements if you haven't already.

## 1. Deploy the Smart Contract

To deploy a smart contract, you must provide a wallet to deploy from. If you
don't have the `walletId`, you can use the
[`GET /wallets`](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/get-wallets)
API to acquire the wallet ID. Ensure the wallet custody type is
Developer-Controlled and the blockchain is Polygon Amoy. We recommend the
account type be SCA - removing the need for gas in your wallet for deployment.
Lastly, note down the wallet's address. This will be used in the subsequent
steps.

Deployment Request Parameters:

1. **idempotencyKey**: A unique value generated by the client that the server
   uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request.
2. **name**: The off-chain name of the contract. This will only be represented
   on Circle's System such as the APIs and Developer Services Console. In this
   case, you can use `My First NFT Contract` or any other name you prefer.
3. **walletId**: The ID of the wallet to deploy from.
4. **templateId**: The ID of the chosen template. In this case, you will use
   `76b83278-50e2-4006-8b63-5b1a2a814533` as the ID for the NFT template. This
   `templateId` and other template-specific details are listed in the
   [Templates Glossary](/contracts/scp-templates-overview).
5. **blockchain**: The network to deploy onto. In this case, you will use
   `MATIC-AMOY`.
6. **entitySecretCiphertext**: The encrypted ciphertext of your entity secret.
   It must be re-encrypted for every new request. Go to
   [How to Re-Encrypt the Entity Secret](/wallets/dev-controlled/entity-secret-management)
   to learn more about generating an entity secret ciphertext.
7. **feeLevel**: A fee level setting (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH). This affects how
   quickly the network will process your deployment transaction. In this case,
   you will use `MEDIUM`.
8. **templateParameters**: A JSON object representing the template deployment
   parameters and arguments. This object is explained in more detail below.

### Template Parameters

Template parameters are the inputs for initializing and deploying the template
on-chain. Each template will have its own set of parameters.

For the NFT template, the required properties are:

1. **name:** The on-chain name for the contract. In this case, you can use
   `My First NFT Contract` or any other name you prefer.
2. **defaultAdmin:** The address of the default admin. This address can execute
   permissioned functions on the contract. This should be an address you control
   or the address of a user if deploying on their behalf. In this case, use the
   developer-controlled wallet's address retrieved from the
   [`GET /wallets`](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/get-wallets)
   API above.
   1. NOTE: The following roles will be given to the defaultAdmin:
      `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `MINTER_ROLE`, `TRANSFER_ROLE`. The `defaultAdmin`
      will also be set as the contract's owner. All of these roles can be
      updated by the defaultAdmin later.
3. **primarySaleRecipient:** The recipient address for first-time sales. All
   first-time sale proceeds will go to this address. In this case, use the
   developer-controlled wallet's address retrieved from the
   [`GET /wallets`](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/get-wallets)
   API above.
4. **royaltyRecipient:** The recipient address for all royalties. Any proceeds
   from secondary sales will go to this address. In this case, use `0`.
5. **royaltyPercent:** The percentage of secondary sales that go to the royalty
   recipient. It should be a value between 0 and 100. In this case, use the
   developer-controlled wallet's address retrieved from the
   [`GET /wallets`](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/get-wallets)
   API above.

There are additional properties and configurations available for more advanced
use cases. Please see the
[Templates Glossary](/contracts/scp-templates-overview) for more information on
configuring the NFT Template and for extended use cases of all template types.

Now that you have all your request parameters in order, you can deploy the smart
contract by making a request to the
[`POST /templates/{id}/deploy`](/api-reference/contracts/smart-contract-platform/deploy-contract-template)
API. You must also pass your entity secret ciphertext in the request body. The
full request is as follows:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js SDK
// Import and configure the developer-controlled wallet SDK
const {
  initiateDeveloperControlledWalletsClient,
} = require("@circle-fin/developer-controlled-wallets");
const circleDeveloperSdk = initiateDeveloperControlledWalletsClient({

  entitySecret: "<ENTITY_SECRET>",
});

// Import and configure the smart contract SDK
const {
  initiateSmartContractPlatformClient,
} = require("@circle-fin/smart-contract-platform");
const circleContractSdk = initiateSmartContractPlatformClient({

});

const response = await circleContractSdk.deployContractTemplate({

  },
  fee: {

    config: {
      feeLevel: "MEDIUM",
    },
  },
});
```

```coffeescript Python SDK
// Import and configure the developer-controlled wallet SDK
client = utils.init_developer_controlled_wallets_client(api_key=key, entity_secret=entitySecret)

// Import and configure the smart contract SDK

# create an api instance
api_instance = smart_contract_platform.TemplatesApi(scpClient)
try:
    request = smart_contract_platform.TemplateContractDeploymentRequest.from_dict({
      "blockchain": 'MATIC-AMOY',
      "name": 'My First NFT Contract',
      "walletId": '<WALLET_ID>',

    resposne = api_instance.deploy_contract_template("aea21da6-0aa2-4971-9a1a-5098842b1248", request)
    print(resposne)
except smart_contract_platform.ApiException as e:

  }
}
```

<Note>
A successful API response indicates that the deployment process has been
initiated but does not guarantee that the deployment will be successful. The
returned `transactionId` can be used to check the status of the deployment
transaction using
[get a transaction](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/get-transaction).
</Note>

To validate that your contract has deployed successfully, make a request to
[GET /transactions/\{id}](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/get-transaction),
providing the ID of the transaction received in the response above.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js SDK
const response = await circleDeveloperSdk.listTransactions({});
```

```coffeescript Python SDK
# create an api instance
api_instance = developer_controlled_wallets.TransactionsApi(client)

try:
    resposne = api_instance.list_transactions()
    print(resposne)
except developer_controlled_wallets.ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling TransactionsApi->list_transactions: %s\n" % e)
```

```curl Curl
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.circle.com/v1/w3s/transactions/{id} \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>'
```

</CodeGroup>

```json Response
{
  "data": {
    "transaction": {
      "id": "601a0815-f749-41d8-b193-22cadd2a8977",
      "blockchain": "MATIC-AMOY",
      "state": "COMPLETE",
      ...
      [other fields truncated]
    }
  }
}
```

The returned `contractId` can be used to perform further management and
interaction with the deployed smart contract, such as minting an NFT.

## 2. Mint an NFT

Let's dive into the Developer Services Console to explore its full range of
capabilities. With the Console, you can seamlessly explore the NFT contract you
deployed. Gain insights into its ABI functions, inspect their inputs, and easily
execute functions through an API call by conveniently copying the required code.

_Alternatively, you can retrieve detailed information about the contract using
the
[`Get contract by ID`](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/get-wallet)
response, which includes all the available functions and events._

In this example, we will use the code snippet generator to build the contract
execution request for the `mintTo` function - which mints an NFT to a user
without a sale. This can be done by selecting the contract within the Console,
then in the ABI functions tab, selecting write, and selecting mintTo.

<Frame>
  <img src="/w3s/images/scp-dnftsc-consolemint02.png" />
</Frame>

As you fill in the parameters for the `mintTo` function, the code to make a
contract execution API request and mint the NFT is automatically generated. Make
sure to select your preferred wallet type and code generated, in this case,
select a Developer Controlled wallet and Shell to create a cURL request example.

mintTo function parameters:

1. **\_to:** The wallet address that the NFT will be minted to. In this case,
   use the wallet address of the wallet you deployed the contract from.
   Ultimately, this can be any wallet on-chain.
2. **\_uri:** A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset.
   This can be a IPFS CID, a CDN URI or any other resource identifier.

As a result of plugging these parameters in, you will be provided with a code
block similar to the one below. Once copied to your preferred API client, add
your `walletId` and `entitySecretCiphertext` to the API request.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js SDK
const response = await circleDeveloperSdk.createContractExecutionTransaction({
  walletId: "<WALLET_ID>",
  abiFunctionSignature: "mintTo(address,string)",
  abiParameters: [
    "0x6E5eAf34c73D1CD0be4e24f923b97CF38e10d1f3",
    "ipfs://bafkreibdi6623n3xpf7ymk62ckb4bo75o3qemwkpfvp5i25j66itxvsoei",
  ],
  contractAddress: "0xf7761519cf2d84c31f634e249790b4757c10a103",
  fee: {
    type: "level",
    config: {
      feeLevel: "MEDIUM",
    },
  },
});
```

```coffeescript Python SDK
# create an api instance
api_instance = developer_controlled_wallets.TransactionsApi(client)
try:
    request = developer_controlled_wallets.CreateContractExecutionTransactionForDeveloperRequest.from_dict({
        "walletId": '<WALLET_ID>',
        "abiFunctionSignature": 'mintTo(address,string)',
        "abiParameters": [
          '0x6E5eAf34c73D1CD0be4e24f923b97CF38e10d1f3',
          'ipfs://bafkreibdi6623n3xpf7ymk62ckb4bo75o3qemwkpfvp5i25j66itxvsoei'
        ],
        "contractAddress": '0xf7761519cf2d84c31f634e249790b4757c10a103',
        "feeLevel": 'MEDIUM',
    })
    resposne = api_instance.create_developer_transaction_contract_execution(request)
    print(resposne)
except developer_controlled_wallets.ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling TransactionsApi->create_developer_transaction_contract_execution: %s\n" % e)
```

```shell Shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.circle.com/v1/w3s/developer/transactions/contractExecution \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "abiFunctionSignature": "mintTo(address,string)",
    "abiParameters": [
        "0x6E5eAf34c73D1CD0be4e24f923b97CF38e10d1f3",
        "ipfs://bafkreibdi6623n3xpf7ymk62ckb4bo75o3qemwkpfvp5i25j66itxvsoei"
    ],
    "idempotencyKey": "a8350bbe-98b1-4204-aadd-385865530c79",
    "contractAddress": "0xf7761519cf2d84c31f634e249790b4757c10a103",
    "feeLevel": "MEDIUM",
    "walletId": "<WALLET_ID>",
    "entitySecretCiphertext": "<ENTITY_SECRET_CIPHERTEXT>"
}'
```

</CodeGroup>

**Note** that the address of the `walletId` must have the `MINTER_ROLE` on the
contract to mint an NFT. Make sure you use the appropriate `walletId`.

```json JSON
{
  "data": {
    "id": "601a0815-f749-41d8-b193-22cadd2a8977",
    "state": "INITIATED"
  }
}
```

<Note>
**Transaction Processing**

A successful API response indicates that the `mintTo` transaction has been
initiated but does not guarantee that the deployment will be successful.

</Note>

To validate that your contract has deployed successfully, make a request to
[`GET /transactions/{id}`](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/get-transaction)
providing the ID of the transaction received in the response above.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js SDK
const response = await circleDeveloperSdk.getTransaction({
  id: "601a0815-f749-41d8-b193-22cadd2a8977",
});
```

```coffeescript Python SDK
# create an api instance
api_instance = developer_controlled_wallets.TransactionsApi(client)

try:
    resposne = api_instance.get_transaction(id='601a0815-f749-41d8-b193-22cadd2a8977')
    print(resposne)
except developer_controlled_wallets.ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling TransactionsApi->get_transaction: %s\n" % e)
```

```curl Curl
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.circle.com/v1/w3s/transactions/{id} \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>'
```

</CodeGroup>

```json Response
{
  "data": {
    "transaction": {
      "id": "601a0815-f749-41d8-b193-22cadd2a8977",
      "blockchain": "MATIC-AMOY",
      "state": "COMPLETE",
      ...
      [other fields truncated]
    }
  }
}
```

Once the transaction is complete, the receiver - the `_to` address that you
previously specified - will now be able to use and interact with the minted NFT.

Congratulations, you have deployed a smart contract and minted an NFT!

## Next steps

1. Learn how to mint NFTs via the
   [Console](/contracts/deploy-smart-contract-template#console-ui-path).
2. Deploy a Token or Multi-Token contract.
