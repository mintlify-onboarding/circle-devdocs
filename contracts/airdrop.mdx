The Airdrop template is an audited, ready-to-deploy, airdrop smart contract for
ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, or native tokens. The airdrop is performed by
“pushing tokens,” which happens when the contract owner transfers tokens to the
receivers’ addresses. Receivers do not need to take any action and do not incur
a gas fee.

The following are common use cases for the Airdrop template:

- **Bulk token distribution**: Automatically distribute tokens to users in bulk.
  For example, project teams or token issuers can reward their community
  members, early adopters, and participants in specific campaigns by
  distributing tokens directly to their blockchain addresses.
- **Marketing and promotion**: Increase awareness and engagement with a project
  or token. When a project distributes tokens to a large number of users, this
  attracts attention and incentivizes users to explore and participate in the
  project's ecosystem.
- **Community building and engagement**: Foster a strong and active community
  around a project. Distribute tokens to community members to incentivize them
  to stay engaged, participate in discussions, provide feedback, and contribute
  to the overall growth and success of the project.

<Warning>
  We recommend setting a maximum of 500 recipients per airdrop transaction. More
  than 500 recipients can cause the blockchain fees to spike or the transaction
  to fail.
</Warning>

## Deployment parameters

The Airdrop template creates a customized airdrop smart contract to distribute
ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, or native tokens to multiple users. To create a
contract using this template, provide the following parameter values when
deploying a smart contract template. To deploy a template, send a `POST` request
to the `/templates/{id}/deploy` endpoint.

**Template ID**: 13e322f2-18dc-4f57-8eed-4bddfc50f85e
