**Wallets** is a comprehensive solution that empowers developers to build
flexible, secure, and scalable embedded wallets into their applications. Wallets
provides an end-to-end solution by addressing the following key areas:

- **Key management**
- **Account setup**
- **Blockchain infrastructure**

Wallets supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins,
fungible tokens, and NFTs, and is compatible with **ERC-20**, **ERC-721**, and
**ERC-1155** on EVM, as well as **SPL tokens** on Solana.

With Wallets, developers can customize their wallet solutions to fit specific
use cases without managing the complexity of security, transaction monitoring,
account recovery, or blockchain infrastructure.

<Note>
**What is a wallet?**

In the crypto world, a wallet refers to a solution that allows users to
**store**, **send**, **receive**, or **spend** digital assets. A wallet can
exist as software (a program or service) or hardware (a device or physical
medium). Contrary to popular belief, wallets do not store digital assets
themselves; instead, they store the **private keys** that grant access to these
assets, which reside on blockchain networks.

## Challenges with wallets

Building a seamless and consistent wallet experience remains challenging,
limiting the ability for developers to quickly launch apps and onboard their
users to interact with onchain ecosystems. Some key challenges include:

- Unfamiliar authentication methods available to onboard users.
- The complexity of securely managing private keys.
- Fragmented developer experience due to reliance on multiple vendors.
- Lack of scalable infrastructure to handle high throughput (TPS) for onchain
  transactions.
- Opaque debugging processes for transaction statuses, including failures.
- Cumbersome management of Web3-specific features like gas fees and nonces.
- High audit costs and steep learning curves to incorporate smart contracts into
  applications.

## Circle Wallets

**Circle Wallets** is a Wallet as a Service (WaaS) solution designed to simplify
the creation and management of secure Web3 wallets and their private keys. It
allows for developers to implement key management models that fit their needs,
easily enhance wallet functionality while prioritizing user experience, and
seamlessly integrate smart contracts in their apps.

Developers can use **RESTful APIs**, **Web SDKs**, and **Mobile SDKs** (for
Android and iOS) to interact with Wallets. The offering is structured into three
key components:

1. **[Secure Key Management](/wallets/key-management)**. Offers passkeys stored
   on user devices or Multi-Party Computation (MPC) backed keys, which can be
   configured as user-controlled or developer-controlled.
2. **[Flexible Account Setup](/wallets/account-types)**. Supports Externally
   Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Modular Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs), enabling
   customization for specific use cases.
3. **[Scalable Blockchain Infrastructure](/wallets/blockchain-infrastructure)**.
   Provides managed node infrastructure for public blockchains to broadcast
   transactions, read balances, and index transactions at scale. Developers can
   also use **[Signing APIs](/wallets/signing-apis)** on NEAR and other EVM
   chains, or even integrate their own blockchain infrastructure for broader
   chain compatibility.

With Circle Wallets, developers can simplify wallet management, reduce costs,
and focus on delivering seamless Web3 experiences.
