This article describes the supported wallet infrastructure models, or wallet
types, to help you determine which type best meets the needs of your end-users.
Each wallet type has specific requirements and provides specific benefits. Use
the information in this topic to choose the wallet type that best supports your
business objectives.

## Wallet types

Infrastructure models govern who controls the digital assets in a specific
wallet. Businesses and individuals need to understand the characteristics of
each type of infrastructure to determine the correct wallet for their needs.

Circle Wallets offer two infrastructure models: **user-controlled wallets** and
**developer-controlled wallets**. Each model provides distinct advantages to
suit different requirements.

### User-controlled wallets

User-controlled wallets grant full autonomy to your users. We offer different
authentication methods and use different encryption mechanisms to ensure the
uses have complete control over their wallets. The user-controlled wallet setup
prioritizes security while providing a familiar and seamless Web2-like user
experience.

There are Web, iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs available for user-controlled
wallets. To start building, see
[Quickstarts for Social Logins or Email Authentication](/wallets/user-controlled/create-your-first-wallet-with-social-logins).

### Developer-controlled wallets

Developer-controlled wallets allow developers to retain control over their
users' wallets while streamlining user interactions with the Web3 ecosystem.
These wallets facilitate various blockchain interactions on behalf of the users,
such as sending and receiving digital assets, smart contract interactions, and
NFT minting. With developer-controlled wallets, users can enjoy the benefits of
the blockchain without needing to understand its complexities or manage private
keys.

To start building developer-controlled wallets, see
[Create Your First Developer-Controlled Wallet](/wallets/dev-controlled/create-your-first-wallet).

## Choosing your wallet type

The critical distinction between user-controlled and developer-controlled
wallets is which party controls the ability to access the private key used to
interact with the blockchain.

User-controlled and developer-controlled wallets can make transactions, interact
with smart contracts, and sign messages. In the case of a user-controlled
wallet, the user controls these abilities. In the case of a developer-controlled
wallet, the developer has this control.

### Why choose user-controlled wallets?

User-controlled wallets give your app's users access and control over the
underlying private keys of their wallets. Circle provides a Web2-like user
experience, abstracting the complexity of seed phrases from your users.
Additionally, Circle uses best-in-class security approaches to power Wallets
with multi-party computation (MPC) technology.

User-controlled wallets offer three authentication methods for which you can
design your applicationâ€™s onboarding UX: social logins, email, or PIN. For more,
see [Authentication Methods](/wallets/user-controlled/authentication-methods).

With user-controlled wallets, your users have access to the speed and security
of the blockchain but with a much more familiar user experience.

### Why choose developer-controlled wallets?

Developer-controlled wallets allow you to create and manage asset flows on
behalf of your users, providing them with easy-to-use access to Web3
functionality. These wallets allow you to control virtually all blockchain
interactions for your users, like sending and receiving digital assets, smart
contract interactions, and NFT minting.

By using developer-controlled wallets, your users do not need to understand the
complexities of the Web3 ecosystem or worry about losing their assets because of
a lost seed phrase to access the speed of the blockchain.

## Summary

This article explores the various options available for wallets, taking into
account both the account type and the infrastructure model. The infrastructure
model determines who controls the assets in the wallet, while the account type
determines the underlying structure of the wallet itself. Understanding these
concepts is essential for developers to make informed decisions that align with
their specific use cases.
