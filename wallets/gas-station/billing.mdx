To ensure a smooth and transparent billing reimbursement process, please note
the following details regarding bill payments for gas fee sponsorships made
through Gas Station:

1. **Reimbursement and Invoicing:** As the policyholder, you are responsible for
   reimbursing Circle for all the gas fee sponsorships made on your behalf.
   Invoices will be generated and sent to you, including applicable local taxes
   and a 5% processing fee.
2. **Period and Frequency:** Bills are charged at the earliest occurrence of two
   events:  
   The 1st of each calendar month: On this date, the gas fee sponsorships are
   made on your behalf will be consolidated into a bill for that specific
   billing period.
3. **Accumulation of $100 worth of gas fees:** If the cumulative value of your
   gas fee sponsorships reaches or exceeds $100 before the 1st of the month, a
   bill will be generated at that point.
4. **Payment Terms:** Invoices must be settled within seven days of being issued
   or up to $20 in additional Gas Station charges. It is essential to adhere to
   these payment terms to ensure uninterrupted gas fee sponsorship and the
   continued functionality of Gas Station.
5. **Consequences of Unpaid Bills:** Failure to pay a bill within seven days
   after it is invoiced or upon accumulating an additional $20 in Gas Station
