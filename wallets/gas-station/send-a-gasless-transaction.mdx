This step-by-step guide lays out the process for sending gasless transactions
from your wallet on <Glossary term="Testnet" />. Gasless transactions are no
different than any other Programmable Wallet transaction. As long as a
<Glossary term="Gas Station policy" /> is configured, and you use a supported
wallet, <Glossary term="gas fees" /> will be sponsored automatically.

<Note>
  For **Testnet**, a preconfigured policy is already in place. Therefore, you
  are not required to create a Gas Station policy for this quickstart guide.
</Note>

Before you begin, it's important to understand which blockchains support gasless
transactions and the wallet types supported on each.

- The following **EVM chains** support smart contract accounts (SCAs) for
  gasless transactions:

  - **Arbitrum**: Mainnet, Sepolia testnet
  - **Avalanche**: Mainnet, Fuji testnet
  - **Base**: Mainnet, Sepolia testnet
  - **Ethereum**: Mainnet, Sepolia testnet
  - **Optimism**: Mainnet, Sepolia testnet
  - **Polygon**: Mainnet, Amoy testnet
  - **Unichain**: Mainnet, Sepolia testnet

- **Aptos** supports externally owned accounts (EOAs)
- **Solana** supports externally owned accounts (EOAs)

## 1. Create a Wallet

To create a wallet, follow our comprehensive quickstart guide on
[creating your first developer-controlled wallet](/wallets/dev-controlled/create-your-first-wallet).
Remember, you must create an SCA wallet for EVM chains to perform gasless
transactions while you must create an EOA wallet on Solana. Once the wallet is
successfully created, note down the wallet's address from step 3.

Alternatively, if you prefer to use user-controlled wallets, follow the
[Create Your First Wallet](/wallets/user-controlled/react-native-sdk-ui-customization-api)
guide.

## 2. Fund the Wallet

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

Next, you will fund your wallet with a token to provide an asset for conducting
transactions. In this guide, we will transfer USDC into the wallet using the
[USDC faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/). While on the
<Glossary term="faucet" />, provide your wallet's address to complete the
process.

Alternatively, if you prefer to deposit a native token, you can visit the
[ETH](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia) or
[MATIC](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) faucets.

## 3. Send a Transfer

Follow the instructions in the quick start guide
[Transfer Tokens from Wallet to Wallet](/wallets/dev-controlled/transfer-tokens-across-wallets).
This guide will walk you through sending a transaction without requiring gas.
Once completed, you can head to the
[developer dashboard policies page](https://console.circle.com/gas-station/policies)
and view the sponsored transaction within the respective policy.

For those using user-controlled wallets, follow the
[Send an Outbound Transfer](/wallets/user-controlled/send-outbound-transfer)
instead.
