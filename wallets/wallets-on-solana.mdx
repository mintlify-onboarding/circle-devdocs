## Solana-specific features

- **Account type upon wallet creation**: In Solana, you can only specify the
  Externally Owned Account (EOA) type when creating a wallet. The Smart Contract
  Account (SCA) account type is specifically for ERC-4337 (account abstraction)
  implementation and is not supported in Solana.
- **Transaction acceleration/cancellation**: Solana allows you to specify a
  higher priority fee to attempt to accelerate a transaction. However, you
  cannot replace an existing transaction with a higher transaction fee, which
  means the existing API for accelerating or cancelling transactions is not
  supported in Solana.
- **Signing message and typed data**: Solana only supports signing messages and
  does not support signing typed data.
- **Associated Token Account (ATA)**: When transferring SPLs in Solana, an ATA
  is automatically created for the recipient, which ensures that they can
  receive tokens. Since extra network fees are associated with the first
  transaction of a token, you must have enough fees available in your
  originating wallet.

  <Warning>

  **Arbitrary token accounts are not supported**. Circle Wallets on Solana only
  support Associated Token Accounts (ATAs). Transactions involving non-ATA
  accounts are not parsed, and tokens sent to such accounts may be permanently
  lost and cannot be recovered.

  </Warning>

- **Gas Station**: Gas Station is a feature of Wallets that lets developers
  sponsor network fees on behalf of their end users. Solana natively supports
  the Gas Station feature with `feePayer`, while EVM chains require using SCAs
  to utilize the gas station feature. We’ve integrated this Solana support into
  our Gas Station so that you can sponsor transaction fees for EOA wallets on
  Solana.
- **Gas specification**: The gas fee mechanism on Solana is similar to EIP-1559:
  you can specify a priority fee to incentivize validators to include your
  transaction in a block. Note that on Solana there is no concept of a “max fee”
  and `gasLimit` is optional. Solana defaults to a gas limit of 200,000
  micro-lamport (10^-15 SOL).

## Migrate from EVM chains to Solana

To transition from EVM chains to Solana, set the `blockchains` parameter value
to `SOL` on mainnet, or `SOL-DEVNET` on testnet.

When creating wallets for end-users, follow these steps to allow them to
transfer assets:

## Step 1. Create Solana wallets

For
[developer-controlled wallets](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/create-wallet),
use existing wallet sets to generate Solana wallets and change the following
body params:

- **accountType**: Set to `EOA`
- **blockchains**: Set to `SOL` or `SOL-DEVNET`
- **walletSetId**: Set to the existing wallet set ID

For
[user-controlled wallets](/api-reference/wallets/user-controlled-wallets/create-user-wallet),
use the same `X-User-Token` header parameter for the same end-user. If it
expires,
[create a new user token](/api-reference/wallets/user-controlled-wallets/get-user-token).
Change the following body parameters:

- **accountType**: Set to `EOA`
- **blockchains**: Set to `SOL` or `SOL-DEVNET`

Next, for both wallets, specify the wallet metadata associated with an end-user
during or after wallet creation:

- **name**: Set to the wallet name, for example: `User Wallet1`
- **refId**: Set to the unique identifier of the reference, for example: `UUID1`

## Step 2. Request test token

To fund Solana
[testnet](/api-reference/w3s/programmable-wallets/request-testnet-tokens)
wallets, update the following body params:

- **blockchain**: `SOL-DEVNET`
- **address**: Set to the newly created Solana wallet address

## Step 3. Set up the Gas Station policy for Solana

Set up the [Gas Station policy](/wallets/gas-station/policy-management) for
Solana in mainnet. Testnet environments come with pre-set default policies.

## Step 4. Execute transactions

Specify the transaction detail in the following API endpoints:

- [`POST` `/transactions/transfer`](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/create-developer-transaction-transfer)
- [`POST` `/transactions/transfer/estimateFee`](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/create-transfer-estimate-fee)

<Warning>

Ensure the `blockchains` body parameter is set to `SOL` or `SOL-DEVNET`

</Warning>

<Note>

The response to a `POST` request to the `/transactions/transfer/estimateFee`
endpoint is the same for each fee level (`high`, `medium`, `low`).

</Note>
