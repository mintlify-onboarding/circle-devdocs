## Common Considerations

All implementations of notification messages have the following attributes:

| Name               | Type   | Description                                                         | Example                                |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `subscriptionId`   | string | ID of the webhook subscription.                                     | `80b9b08f-fd12-4f40-a3a6-51bad45cec51` |
| `notificationId`   | string | ID for each event notification. This value is the same for retries. | `b3f2761f-6ae8-49f8-a730-6216aea08900` |
| `notificationType` | string | The type of notification.                                           | `transactions.inbound`                 |
| `version`          | int    | The version of the notification.                                    | `2`                                    |

## Implementations

This section lists models used by existing flows.

## Transaction Flows

This section introduces the events that may occur with a transaction.

### Inbound Transactions

#### Confirmed

Confirmed transactions have been broadcast on the blockchain but have not yet
reached the number of confirmations needed to be considered complete.

**Confirmed Transaction Notification Payload**:

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "80b9b08f-fd12-4f40-a3a6-51bad45cec51",
  "notificationId": "b3f2761f-6ae8-49f8-a730-6216aea08900",
  "notificationType": "transactions.inbound",
  "notification": {
    "id": "",
    ...
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-06-29T15:05:33.135665781Z",
  "version": 2
}
```

The payload will contain the information of a _Transaction Object_.

#### Completed

Completed transactions are settled transactions in which the needed number of
blockchain confirmations has been met. Therefore the funds should be available
in the destination account.

**Completed Transaction Notification Payload:**

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "80b9b08f-fd12-4f40-a3a6-51bad45cec51",
  "notificationId": "b3f2761f-6ae8-49f8-a730-6216aea08900",
  "notificationType": "transactions.inbound",
  "notification": {
    "id": "",
    ...
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-06-29T15:05:33.135665781Z",
  "version": 2
}
```

The payload will contain the information of a _Transaction Object_.

processed.

  "notificationType": "transactions.outbound",
  "notification": {
    "id": "",
    ...
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-06-29T15:05:33.135665781Z",
  "version": 2
}
```

The payload will contain the information of a _Transaction Object_.

#### Sent

been broadcast onchain.

**Sent Transaction Notification Payload**:

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "80b9b08f-fd12-4f40-a3a6-51bad45cec51",

  "notificationType": "transactions.outbound",
  "notification": {
    "id": "",
    ...
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-06-29T15:05:33.135665781Z",
  "version": 2
}
```

The payload will contain the information of a _Transaction Object_.

#### Confirmed

Confirmed transactions have been successfully broadcast on the blockchain but
have not yet reached the number of confirmations needed to be considered
complete.

**Confirmed Transaction Notification Payload**:

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "80b9b08f-fd12-4f40-a3a6-51bad45cec51",

#### Failed

A transaction might fail due to insufficient balance, failed challenge and so
forth. A notification with the following structure is sent for _failed_
transactions:

**Failed Transaction Notification Payload**:

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "80b9b08f-fd12-4f40-a3a6-51bad45cec51",

  "version": 2
}
```

The payload will contain the information of a _Transaction Object_.

### Challenge Flows

This section introduces the events that may occur with a challenge.

#### Complete

Complete challenges indicate that the operation has been successfully passed by
the end-user. Therefore the associated action should be automatically initiated.

**Complete Challenge Notification Payload**:

  "timestamp": "2023-06-29T15:05:33.135665781Z",
  "version": 2
}
```

The payload will contain the information of a _Challenge Object_.

Challenges can fail for reasons such as an incorrect pin being entered, the
challenge expiring and so forth. A notification with the following structure is
sent for failed challenges. This indicates that the operation needs to be
re-initiated.

**Failed Challenge Notification Payload**:

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "80b9b08f-fd12-4f40-a3a6-51bad45cec51",
