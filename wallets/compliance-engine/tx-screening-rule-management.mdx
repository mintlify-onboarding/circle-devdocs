Your transaction screening rules are the rules against which your screening
events (embedded or address) will be evaluated. They will contain the rule
criteria that will trigger the rule as well as the applicable or suggested
actions for each rule if triggered. For Testnet, there are a number of default
rules in place which you can use to test against (see
[Testing Guide](/wallets/compliance-engine/tx-screening-testing)).

<Warning>
**Rules on Mainnet**

On Mainnet, we also have a number of default rules in place as a starting point.
However, they may not be sufficient to address your company‚Äôs compliance
obligations and/or risk appetite. We recommend that you consult legal counsel
when evaluating
[compliance requirements](https://6778953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6778953/PDFs/Whitepapers/ComplianceEngine_whitepaper.pdf)
as they relate to your unique business model and the jurisdictions in which you
operate. Once you have done so, you can set up appropriate configurable rules to
address your risks.

</Warning>

## Rule Configurations

There are two types of rules for
[Transaction Screening](/wallets/compliance-engine/tx-screening) which can be
configured: _Restrictive Rules_ and _Alert-only Rules_.

A rule consists of the following:

1. **Name:** This is auto generated based on the rule criteria and actions.
2. **Description:** This is an optional text field to provide a summary of what
   the rule is designed to accomplish.
3. **Actions**: What actions should be applied or suggested when a rule is
   matched. There are two distinct rule types, _Restrictive_ and _Alert-only_,
   for which the following actions are associated:  
   a. **Transaction Decision**: this action allows you to prevent outgoing
   transactions from being broadcast. It is available as a _restrictive_ rule
   only.  
   b. **Wallet Freeze**: this action allows you to freeze the funds in the
   associated Circle Wallet. It is available as a _restrictive_ rule only.  
   c. **Generate an Alert**: this action will trigger the generation of an alert
   in your Alerts Table within the [Console](https://console.circle.com/). This
   is optional on _restrictive_ rules but mandatory on _alert-only_ rules.
4. **Rule Criteria**: What combination of risk signals should a rule alert on.
   There are three unique criteria to be set with each rule:  
   a. **Risk Category**: general categorization of the risk that has been
   flagged for the entity in question.  
   b. **Risk Score**: representative value for the level of risk associated with
   the entity.  
   c. **Risk Type**: level of exposure for the risk involved. Is the address
   directly or indirectly associated with the risk?

## Mandatory Rules

There are a number of rules in place by default that have minimal configuration
options, e.g. the ability to toggle the alert action. These rules are as
follows:

- **Circle‚Äôs Sanctions Blocklist.** This rule is in line with the mandatory
  [Compliance Requirements](/w3s/compliance-requirements#ofac-sanctions-compliance-in-terms-of-service)
  you must adhere to when using Circle Wallets. Wallets and transactions will be
  restricted if they are detected sending or receiving from any OFAC-sanctioned
  address.
- **Your blocklist.** This rule relates to the
  [Watchlists](/wallets/compliance-engine/tx-screening-rule-management#watchlists)
  functionality.
- **Frozen.** This rule is used to enforce the wallet freeze, which is applied
  to wallets by other transaction screening rules, or via the developer console.
- **Your allowlist.** This rule relates to the
  [Watchlists](/wallets/compliance-engine/tx-screening-rule-management#watchlists)
  functionality.

## Configurable Rule Criteria Combinations

The table below outlines all possible criteria combinations that can be used to
create/configure rules.

## Rule Setup

To create or edit a rule, follow these steps:

1. **Access Settings page**: Using your credentials, log in to the Circle
   [Console](https://console.circle.com/). From there, navigate to the
   **Compliance Engine > Settings** section, which allows you to manage your
   screening rules conveniently.
2. **Choose to create or edit a rule**: Select the appropriate rule type
   _Configurable **restrictive** rules_ or _Configurable **alert-only** rules_.
   To edit an existing rule, select the rule in question and click the `Edit`
   button. To add a new rule, select `Add Rule`.
3. **Configure the rule**: Set the desired rule (_description_, _actions_, and
   _criteria_) based on your requirements. Refer to the above
   [possible configurations](/wallets/compliance-engine/tx-screening-rule-management#configurable-rule-criteria-combinations)
   for clarity on the available options.
4. **Update or create the rule**: After applying the necessary configurations,
   select either:
   - `Save` to modify an existing rule; or
   - `Create Rule` button (top-right of page) to create a new rule.

## Deactivating a Rule

New rules will be created in an _active_ state by default. If you need to
temporarily deactivate a rule, you can do so as follows:

1. **Select the rule.** Using your credentials, log in to the Circle
   [Console](https://console.circle.com/). From there, navigate to the
   **Compliance Engine > Settings** section, select the rule you wish to change,
   and select the `Edit` button.
2. **Toggle the Rule Status.** Rule status is located at the bottom of the page.
   Just toggle the Rule Status from `Active` to `Inactive`.
3. **Save change.**

## Deleting a Rule

If you need to permanently delete a rule, you can do so as follows:

1. **Select the rule.** Using your credentials, log in to the Circle
   [Console](https://console.circle.com/). From there, navigate to the
   **Compliance Engine > Settings** section, select the rule you wish to change.
2. **Delete the rule.** Select the `Delete` button twice.

## Watchlists

Another method for influencing your rule configuration is via the _Watchlists_
feature. You can influence the screening evaluations by adding blockchain
addresses to either the _Blocklist_ or the _Allowlist_.

These lists act as the inputs for two of your default rules:

- _Your blocklist_ will deny any transaction where the associated address has
  been added to your blocklist.
- _Your allowlist_ will allow any transaction where the associated address has
  been added to your allowlist.

To add an address to either your allowlist or your blocklist:

1. **Access the Watchlists page.** Using your credentials log into the Circle
   [Console](https://console.circle.com/). Navigate to the _Watchlists_ page
   under the _Compliance Engine_.
2. **Choose the appropriate list.** Select the appropriate tab between
   _Blocklist_ and _Allowlist_ for your desired outcome.
3. **Add entry.** Select the `Add Entry` button on the top right. Enter the
   blockchain address, choose the reason, and leave an optional note explaining
   the addition.
