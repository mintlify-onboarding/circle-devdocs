The [Alerts](https://console.circle.com/compliance/alerts/screening) page on the
console gives you access to all historical alerts generated. From there you can
view summary data on each alert and access other key alert management features:

1. **Access the Alerts page.** Using your credentials log into the Circle
   [Console](https://console.circle.com/). Navigate to the _Alerts_ page under
   the _Compliance Engine_.
2. **Browse historical alerts.** Can browse for historical alerts via the
   tabular view.
3. **Select alert to review.** Selecting any alert will let you view the alert
   page. This page provides detailed alert-level information for review. You can
   also navigate to a number of other pages that will provide further
   information on entities related to the alert.  
   a. **Wallet Page**. Provides detailed risk information on the associated
   blockchain wallet that triggered the alert. You can reach this by selecting
   the hyperlinked _Wallet Address_ under the _Entities_ section.  
   b. **Transaction Page**. Provides detailed data points on the transaction
   associated with the alert. You can reach this by selecting the hyperlinked
   _Transaction ID_ under the _Transaction_ section.
4. **Action Alert.** There are a number of actions available for you to take
   directly from the Alert page.  
   a. **Freeze Wallet.** You can freeze the wallet associated with the
   transaction in question via the `Freeze Wallet` button in the **Entities >
   Action** column.  
   b. **Add to blocklist.** You can add external addresses directly to your
   _blocklist_ instead of navigating to the _Watchlists_ page via the
   `Add to blocklist` button in the **Entities > Action** column  
   c. **Alert Status.** You can close out any alert by adjusting its _Status_
   via the dropdown to the right of the _Alert ID_ in the table header.
