_Transaction Screening_ (available as Beta) is a real-time tool that
automatically checks blockchain transactions and associated addresses for risks
related to sanctioned entities, terrorist financing, or other suspicious
behaviors. This is a core component of the
[Compliance Engine](/wallets/compliance-engine) and it allows developers to
configure screening rules to meet the specific compliance requirements of their
jurisdiction or industry.

Developers can trigger screening evaluations using two methods:

- _Embedded_, where screening occurs implicitly during regular programmable
  wallet transaction flow.
- _Standalone_, where screening is triggered explicitly through the Compliance
  API.

## Features

- **Custom Rules**: Tailor your own screening rules to match your specific use
  and regulatory requirements.
- **Blocklist/Whitelist**: Developers can specify blacklisted or whitelisted
  addresses, enhancing control over transactions and minimizing the chance of
  interacting with known bad actors.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: The system provides immediate notifications when a
  transaction violates pre-set screening rules. Alerts can trigger actions such
  as blocking a transaction, freezing a wallet, or sending it for further manual
  review.
- **Detailed Logs and API Integration**: Developers can access detailed logs and
  results of screened transactions, enabling easier auditing and review. The
  system also offers a robust API for integrating screening functionality into
  existing workflows.

## API Overview

## Embedded screening

For Wallets using embedded screening, the existing
[Get a transaction](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/get-transaction)
API endpoint includes a response field, `transactionScreeningEvaluation`, for
transaction screening result, detailing:

- **Rule** found during screening
- **Actions** taken for the decision
- **Reasons** for the decision, related risk signals found during the screening:
  source, risk score, risk category, etc.

## Standalone screening

For Wallets developers using standalone screening, the Compliance Engine exposes
a new
[Screen a blockchain address](/api-reference/wallets/compliance/screen-address) API
endpoint, enabling you to screen a specific blockchain address on a given
[supported chain](/w3s/supported-blockchains-and-currencies) independently of
any transaction flow. The endpoint response returns the following:

- **Screening result**: High level of the screening result, either `APPROVED` or
  `DENIED`.
- **Screening decision**: Same information as the
  `transactionScreeningEvaluation` field above.
- **Detailed vendor response**: Findings from vendors to provide a deeper
  understanding of the screening results and their source. Note: values will
  only be available on testnet for the test cases provided on the
  [Testing Guide](/wallets/compliance-engine/tx-screening-testing).

## Workflow

On testnet, transaction screening is enabled by default. For mainnet access, you
will need to request access via the
[Circle Console](https://console.circle.com/). Then:

1. Customize your screening rules via the console to match your own risk and
   compliance requirements:  
   a. Check the
   [Compliance Engine whitepaper](https://6778953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6778953/PDFs/Whitepapers/ComplianceEngine_whitepaper.pdf)
   (Part 3) for some helpful questions to consider when establishing your
   requirements.  
   b. Check the
   [Rule Management](/wallets/compliance-engine/tx-screening-rule-management)
   guide for possible configurations.
2. Trigger a screening evaluation:  
   a. Through the
   [Screen a blockchain address](/api-reference/wallets/compliance/screen-address)
   API endpoint.  
   b. Through generating an on-chain transaction via the
   [Transactions API](/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/list-transactions).

You can review detailed results for all rule matches and alerts on the
[Circle Console](https://console.circle.com/).
