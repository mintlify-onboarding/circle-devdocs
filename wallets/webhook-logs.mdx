Logs**. By accessing this tab, you will be presented with an informative

## Detailed Webhook View for Deeper Insight

entry within the Webhook Logs. By clicking on a specific entry, you will be
directed to a dedicated detail page that offers comprehensive information. This
includes nested event object data and an associated table of events, including
their respective Webhook attempts.

This detailed view enables you to gain deeper insights into the specific details
of each Webhook event, aiding in further analysis and troubleshooting. Moreover,
it provides you with the valuable option to resend a Webhook, allowing for
