This guide outlines initiating a signature request from a previously created
user-controlled wallet with social logins or email authentication. To create a
wallet, see
[Create Your First Wallet with Social Logins](/wallets/user-controlled/create-your-first-wallet-with-social-logins)
or
[Create Your First Wallet with Email](/wallets/user-controlled/create-your-first-wallet-with-email).

<Note>
  If it has been over 14 days or you end the last trial attempt since you first
  ran the sample app, your session is logged out. You must run the sample app
  and acquire a new user token to proceed further. For instructions, see the
  perform login part of [Create Your First Wallet with Social
  Logins](/wallets/user-controlled/create-your-first-wallet-with-social-logins)
  or [Create Your First Wallet with Email
  Authentication](/wallets/user-controlled/create-your-first-wallet-with-email).

## Step 1. Initiate a signature request

1. Sign the transaction, EIP-191 message, or EIP-712 typed structure data from a
   specified user-controlled wallet:
   - For a transaction, include `walletId` and `transaction` object or
     `rawTransaction` string in a `POST` request to the `/user/sign/transaction`
     endpoint.
   - For EIP-191, include `walletId` and `message` in a `POST` request to the
     `/user/sign/message` endpoint.
   - For EIP-712, include `walletId` and `data` in a `POST` request to the
     `/user/sign/typedData` endpoint.
2. From the response, copy `challengeId` for the next step.

## Step 2. Perform signing

To perform signing on the sample app's confirmation UI, ensure you have obtained
an active user token and encryption key.

From the Execute Challenge screen, paste the Challenge ID and select
**Execute**.

## Step 3. Confirm signature request

The sample app prompts a confirmation UI for the user to view the signing
details and confirm it. You can customize confirmation UIs. For more, see
[Confirmation UIs](/wallets/user-controlled/confirmation-uis) .
