The type of account you choose along with the wallet type determine the
capabilities of the wallets you create. Circle supports three account types:

- **Externally Owned Accounts (EOA)**
- **Smart Contract Accounts (SCA)**
- **Modular Smart Contract Accounts (MSCA)**

## Blockchain support

The following table shows the blockchain networks and their support for EOAs,
SCAs, and MSCAs.

## Externally Owned Accounts (EOA)

EOAs are Ethereum's most commonly used account type and Solana's only supported
account type. They consist of a private and public key, with the public key
representing the account address. EOAs require secure management of the private
key and always require gas tokens to initiate transactions. While EOAs offer the
flexibility to initiate any transaction, they have certain limitations, such as
the need for a private key and the inability to control them programmatically
onchain.

**Benefits:**

- **Zero Cost Creation**. Creating an Externally Owned Account (EOA) does not
  incur any fees, making it an accessible option for users. This is especially
  important for networks like Ethereum mainnet, where gas costs are higher.
- **Versatile Transaction Initiation**. EOAs can initiate any transaction on the
  Ethereum network, allowing users to interact with various decentralized
  applications and perform a wide range of operations.
- **High outbound TPS**. EOAs, given their simplicity, allow for higher outbound
  TPS than SCAs. This makes them suitable for use cases like mass distribution
  such as airdrops.

**Limitations:**

- **Private Key Dependency**. EOAs require the secure management of a single
  private key that’s paired with the EOA. Users must protect their private key
  to ensure the security and control of their EOA, as it grants access to
  account functions and funds. When users lose this private key, they lose the
  ability to transact tokens in the EOA.
- **Native Token Dependency for Gas (EVM)**. To perform transactions or execute
  operations on the Ethereum network, EOAs must hold native tokens such as Ether
  (ETH) to cover gas fees. These tokens must pay for the computational resources
  utilized during transaction validation and execution. Solana, on the other
  hand, natively supports gas subsidy with `feePayer`, which means developers
  can sponsor gas fees on behalf of the EOA from the users.
- **Advanced Onchain use-cases**. EOAs cannot support any advanced use-cases
  that involve onchain code. Some examples of these include multi-sig wallets,
  session keys, onchain spending limits, etc.

## Smart Contract Accounts (SCA)

SCAs are another type of Ethereum account that replaces an EOA with a smart
contract. SCAs do not have private keys but are controlled by either an EOA, a
passkey, or multiple keys, which interact with the deployed smart contract. SCAs
allow developers to write customized logic within the smart contract, enabling
advanced functionalities. SCAs have been in the Ethereum ecosystem for many
years but recently gained popularity thanks to a new standard called
[ERC-4337 (account abstraction)](https://www.erc4337.io/docs) - a trustless
standard the community could build SCAs around. ERC-4337 also introduced the
concept of paymaster, which enables simplified gas abstraction, enabling anyone
to sponsor gas fees for the end user or let the end user pay for gas in any
ERC-20 token.

**Benefits:**

- **Flexibility of keys**. SCA allows for configuration of the signing key,
  which can be an EOA, a passkey, or multiple keys, as well as the recovery of
  such keys if lost.
- **Gas Abstraction and Fee Sponsorship (EVM)**. SCAs offer gas abstraction,
  simplifying gas fee management for end-users. Developers can implement
  mechanisms, such as the paymaster pattern, to sponsor gas fees on behalf of
  users. This reduces the burden on users to hold and manage native tokens for
  gas and enhances the overall user experience by providing a seamless gas fee
  payment process.
- **Batch Operations**. SCAs allow you to
  [batch related user operations](/wallets/batch-operations), which can provide
  a number of important benefits for end-users. With batched operations, the
  user only has to wait for a single batched transaction, instead of multiple
  individual transactions. Batched transactions will generally cost less gas
  than individually submitted transactions. Batched transactions offer
  atomicity: if any transaction in the batch reverts, the entire batch reverts,
  ensuring that user operations aren't stuck in an inconsistent state.

**Limitations:**

- **Gas Fees Incurred for Creation**. Gas fees are required when creating SCA
  wallets. However, emerging solutions like the one implemented in Programmable
  Wallets address this limitation by introducing a lazy deployment mechanism.
  This process postpones the gas fee payment until the first outbound
  transaction, easing the initial cost burden of SCA wallet creation.

## Modular Smart Contract Accounts (MSCA)

MSCAs are a type of smart accounts that can be extended with different modules
to enhance their functionality (similar to how one can install apps on iPhones
and Android to give the smartphone more functionality). Circle's MSCA adheres to
both [ERC-4337 (account abstraction)](https://www.erc4337.io/docs) and
[ERC-6900](https://www.erc6900.io/) - an ERC standard that Circle engineers are
co-authoring with other ecosystem partners. We enable the creation of MSCAs by
default in our Modular Wallet SDK.

**Benefits:**

- **Custom Logic and Functionality**. Modular Smart Contract Accounts (MSCAs)
  allow developers to build custom logic and functionality directly into the
  account. By deploying smart contracts to control MSCAs, developers can create
  innovative and customized features, enabling advanced capabilities and
  automated operations within the wallet.
- **Flexibility of keys**. MSCA allows for configuration of the signing key,
  which can be an EOA, a passkey, or multiple keys, as well as the recovery of
  such keys if lost.
- **Gas Abstraction and Fee Sponsorship (EVM)**. MSCAs offer gas abstraction,
  simplifying gas fee management for end-users. Developers can implement
  mechanisms, such as the paymaster pattern, to sponsor gas fees on behalf of
  users. This reduces the burden on users to hold and manage native tokens for
  gas and enhances the overall user experience by providing a seamless gas fee
  payment process.
- **Batch Operations**. MSCAs allow you to
  [batch related user operations](/wallets/batch-operations), which can provide
  a number of important benefits for end-users. With batched operations, the
  user only has to wait for a single batched transaction, instead of multiple
  individual transactions. Batched transactions will generally cost less gas
  than individually submitted transactions. Batched transactions offer
  atomicity: if any transaction in the batch reverts, the entire batch reverts,
  ensuring that user operations aren't stuck in an inconsistent state.

**Limitations:**

- **Gas Fees Incurred for Creation**. Gas fees are required when creating MSCA
  wallets. However, emerging solutions like the one implemented in Programmable
  Wallets address this limitation by introducing a lazy deployment mechanism.
  This process postpones the gas fee payment until the first outbound
  transaction, easing the initial cost burden of SCA wallet creation.

The following are the versions of MSCAs supported by Wallets today. The exact
version type is displayed in the successful response when creating a wallet.

## Choosing your account type

SCAs generally provide a more straightforward user experience for most use
cases. They allow developers to focus on creating innovative functionalities in
the smart contract. However, the specific needs of each project should be
carefully considered when choosing between EOA, SCA, or MSCA account types.

<Note>
**Circle recommends using EOAs if you are building on Ethereum**

Creating an SCA wallet might become expensive. Circle strongly recommends using
EOAs if you are using Ethereum, and otherwise use SCAs on L2s.
