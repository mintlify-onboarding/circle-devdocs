The **Programmable Wallet** platform provides comprehensive blockchain
infrastructure support, alongside key management and smart accounts, eliminating
the need to integrate with third-party blockchain infrastructure providers.
Circle's all-in-one offering includes features such as broadcasting, indexing,
gas management, and bundling.

## Features

Circle's blockchain infrastructure simplifies key aspects of blockchain
interactions by offering the following features:

### Broadcasting

For transactions signed on Circle's platform, the platform handles broadcasting
to the blockchain. You can also use Circle's
[Signing APIs](/wallets/signing-apis) to integrate with your preferred node
service providers for broadcasting, offering flexibility and control.

### Indexing

Reading directly from blockchains often results in high latency, which can
negatively impact the user experience. Circle addresses this by:

- Indexing all inbound and outbound transfer events and wallet balances in real
  time.
- Providing access to blockchain data via low-latency APIs, simulating the
  performance of a fast database.
- Offering webhook notifications for deposits and withdrawals to keep you
  informed of wallet balance changes.

To configure or update your webhooks, go to
[Manage webhook subscriptions](/circle-mint/webhook-subscription-management).

### Gas Station

Circle's **Gas Station** simplifies the management of native tokens for gas
fees, abstracting this complexity from your end users. This feature eliminates
the need to integrate with third-party paymasters or fee-payers.

To set up and configure policies, see
[Manage Gas Station policies](/wallets/gas-station/policy-management).

### Bundler

Circle's **Bundler** supports **Smart Contract Accounts (ERC-4337)** by bundling
user operations (userOps) for signing. With Circle's blockchain infrastructure,
you can:

- Create modular smart contract account wallets.
- Initiate transactions without manually constructing and bundling userOps.

## Support

For blockchains where full infrastructure support is not available, you can use
Circle's [Signing APIs](/wallets/signing-apis) to integrate with your preferred
blockchain infrastructure providers.

The table below shows the blockchains supported by Circle and the availability
of full infrastructure support.
