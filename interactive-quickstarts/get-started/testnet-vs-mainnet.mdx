    Testnet is akin to a training ground for developers. It's a simulated
    environment where you can develop, test, and polish your applications with
    confidence. In this space, you can execute transactions and test various
    scenarios without any financial implications, as Testnet does not involve
    real cryptocurrencies or assets.

    Mainnet is where everything goes live. This network handles actual

Before jumping into Mainnet, it is crucial to rigorously test and validate your
applications within the Testnet environment first. This precaution ensures that
all systems and functionalities operate correctly before you transition to a
live environment. Once you have thoroughly vetted your application in Testnet,
you can migrate to Mainnet operations.
