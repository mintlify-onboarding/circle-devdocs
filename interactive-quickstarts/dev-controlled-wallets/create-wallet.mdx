Welcome to a foundational step in utilizing our Developer Services: initiating
your first API call to construct a WalletSet. We'll guide you through the
process and clarify what a WalletSet entails within our platform.

### Defining a WalletSet

A WalletSet within our ecosystem is a sophisticated grouping of wallets,
securely tied together by a singular cryptographic key. Leveraging the
Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet technology, WalletSets offer an enhanced
way to handle wallet management that spans multiple blockchain networks. This is
particularly relevant for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains,
where it is common for wallets on different networks to share the same address,
thanks to the underlying technology.

### Grasping the concept of idempotency

As we approach the creation of your inaugural WalletSet, it's important to
comprehend a critical aspect of our APIs: idempotency keys.

Idempotency is a fundamental concept which guarantees that an operation is
repeatable without changing the outcome. This concept is extremely important in
API requests to make sure that if a request is accidentally sent more than once,
it doesn't result in duplicate operations.

Consider situations like an unstable internet connection leading to multiple
unintentional request submissions, or a user who accidentally activates a
command several times. Without idempotency, such events might cause numerous
unwanted operations.

To prevent this, an idempotency key is used. Each request includes a distinct
key that, when recognized by the server within a certain timeframe as a repeat
submission, prevents the repeated processing of that request. This mechanism is
crucial to preserving the integrity of your operations, ensuring that only
intended actions are carried out.

### Crafting Your WalletSet

Now that we've got the concept of idempotency covered, let's look at creating
your WalletSet.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Parameters
  title="Request parameters"
  linkToDocs="/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/create-wallet-set"
>
  <Parameter name="idempotencyKey">
    Think of this as a safety net. By using a unique UUID for every transaction
    request, you ensure no transaction is mistakenly processed more than once.
    It's a measure against unintended duplicates.
  </Parameter>
  <Parameter name="entitySecretCiphertext">
    Remember the encryption we discussed earlier? You'll need to provide this
    encrypted string for security and authorization.
  </Parameter>
  <Parameter name="name">
    The name for your new WalletSet.
  </Parameter>
</Parameters>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Let's create our first wallet set!

<Playground
  title="Create a WalletSet"
  url="/quickstarts/api/common/wallet-set"
  config={{
    method: "POST",
    url: "/v1/w3s/developer/walletSets",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
    },
    body: {
      idempotencyKey: "<UNIQUE_UUID>",
      entitySecretCipherText: "<GENERATED_ENTITY_SECRET_CIPHERTEXT>",
      name: "<WALLET_SET_NAME>",
    },
  }}
  copy={[{ key: "walletSetId", path: "data.walletSet.id" }]}
/>

<Note>
  Ensure that your idempotency key is unique for every distinct request. Our
  APIs require the idempotency key to be of type uuidv4. Remember, its primary
  role is to ensure that the same request isn't processed more than once.
</Note>

### Utilizing API Logs for Enhanced Monitoring

For a comprehensive overview of each transaction you execute with Circle's Web3
APIs, the Developer Services Console provides detailed access to API logs. By
examining these logs, you gain valuable visibility into how your application
interacts with Circle APIs, which can be pivotal for various aspects including
troubleshooting, performance optimization, and security oversight by
highlighting any abnormal activities. For detailed records of your API
interactions, please refer to the
[API Logs section](https://console.circle.com/logs).

Within the scope of our Quickstart guide, the API log is indispensable for
gaining insights into specific API calls and the objects that are created as a
result. Think of the API log as a detailed record that allows you to retrieve
the unique IDs of objects that have been generated, especially when these IDs
are needed for subsequent API interactions. API logs are a crucial educational
resource that simplify the debugging process and help you methodically
comprehend the intricacies of the API's operations. Hence, the API log is not
only instrumental in improving operational workflows but also serves as a
valuable asset for your development projects.

Ah, the most exhilarating phase: shaping your very first developer-controlled
wallet in the vastness of web3. With your prepped API key and Entity Secret
Ciphertext, we're only a few steps away from crafting a masterpiece. Let's dive
right in!

### Understanding the Developer-Controlled Wallet

In web3, a wallet isn't just a storage mechanism for digital tokens or NFTs, but
the very essence of user interactions on the blockchain. Essentially, it's a
blend of a unique address and accompanying metadata stored on the blockchain.

For developer-controlled wallets:

<Features background="light">
  <Features.Feature icon="BookOpenOutline">
    <Features.Feature.Title>Address</Features.Feature.Title>
    <Features.Feature.Description>
      A unique identifier on a blockchain. Notably, while an address remains
      distinct, multiple wallets can have the same address across different EVM
      blockchains.
    </Features.Feature.Description>
  </Features.Feature>
  <Features.Feature icon="KeyOutline">
    <Features.Feature.Title>Custody Type</Features.Feature.Title>
    <Features.Feature.Description>
      This signifies who controls the private key invocation â€” either the user
      or the developer. For our purpose, we're focusing on developer-controlled
      wallets, which are inherently more manageable and tailored for specific
      app requirements.
    </Features.Feature.Description>
  </Features.Feature>
</Features>

With that foundational knowledge, let's get to the hands-on part.

### Crafting your wallet

To create a wallet you use the following parameters:

<Parameters
  title="Request parameters"
  linkToDocs="/api-reference/wallets/developer-controlled-wallets/create-wallet"
>
  <Parameter name="idempotencyKey">
    Ensures that a request is executed only once, even if it's received multiple
    times.
  </Parameter>
  <Parameter name="entitySecretCiphertext">
    The encrypted form of your Entity Secret, ensuring robust security for your
    API requests.
  </Parameter>
  <Parameter name="walletSetId">
    The ID of the wallet set that you created in the preceding step.
  </Parameter>
  <Parameter name="blockchains">
    Specifies the blockchains on which the wallet should be manifested.
  </Parameter>
  <Parameter name="count">
    The number of wallets you aim to create. **Note:** The parameter should not
    exceed 20.
  </Parameter>
  <Parameter name="accountType">
    The type of account you want to create. For this guide, you will use SCA,
    which represents developer-controlled wallets.
  </Parameter>
</Parameters>

<Note>
To ensure the best possible experience, the quickstart will automatically
create and fund two wallets with testnet tokens. Each wallet will be funded
with **10 USDC**, allowing you to dive right into the Quickstart without
delay. Rest assured, this amount will be sufficient for you to initiate your
first transaction.

The funding process will only be completed if you use the **Try it out**
panel. If you are following the quickstart using code snippets, you will need
to first create your wallets, then fund them manually using the
[testnet faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/).
</Note>

      Authorization: "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>",
    },
    body: {
      idempotencyKey: "<UNIQUE_UUID>",
      entitySecretCipherText: "<GENERATED_ENTITY_SECRET_CIPHERTEXT>",
      blockchains: ["<BLOCKCHAIN_1>", "<BLOCKCHAIN_2>", "<BLOCKCHAIN_3>"],
      count: 2,
      accountType: "SCA",
      walletSetId: "<ID_OF_PREVIOUSLY_GENERATED_WALLET_SET>",
    },
  }}
  copy={[
    {
      path: "data.wallets[0].id",
      key: "devCWalletId",
    },
    {
      path: "data.wallets[1].address",
      key: "devCDestinationAddress",
    },
  ]}
/>

<Note>
**Note:** Smart Contract Account wallets are not availabe for Solana Devnet. A
similar workflow can be accomplished on Solana Devnet with EOA wallets and the
Circle Gas Station.
</Note>

And there you have it! By the end of this step, you'll have fully functional
developer-controlled wallets, ready to shape web3 experiences.
