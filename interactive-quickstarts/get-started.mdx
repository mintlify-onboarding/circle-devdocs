## Understanding Testnet vs Mainnet environments

<Grid>

  <GridItem>
    Testnet is akin to a training ground for developers. It's a simulated
    environment where you can develop, test, and polish your applications with
    confidence. In this space, you can execute transactions and test various
    scenarios without any financial implications, as Testnet does not involve
    real cryptocurrencies or assets.
  </GridItem>

  <GridItem>
    Mainnet is where everything goes live. This network handles actual
    transactions with genuine digital currencies. Operating on Mainnet means
    dealing with real-world consequences and genuine assets. The results of
    actions performed here are immediate and impactful.
  </GridItem>
</Grid>

Before jumping into Mainnet, it is crucial to rigorously test and validate your
applications within the Testnet environment first. This precaution ensures that
all systems and functionalities operate correctly before you transition to a
live environment. Once you have thoroughly vetted your application in Testnet,
you can migrate to Mainnet operations.

<Note>
  In our quickstarts, we use Testnet to guarantee a secure learning experience.
  Your Testnet API key serves as the gateway to this development.

## Create your API key

Generate a standard API key:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to the console">

    Use your login details to log in to the Circle Developer Services console.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to API Keys">

    On the left hand nav, select the [API Keys](/api-keys) page, and then select **CREATE A KEY**.

      <img src="/interactive-quickstarts/get-started/images/api_keys.png" alt="List of API keys" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up your API key">

    On the **Create an API Key** page, enter a name for your API key, and then select **Standard Key**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/interactive-quickstarts/get-started/images/create_key.png" alt="Create new API key form" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy and Store your API key">

    The console displays your key only once after you create it. Make sure to copy the key value and store it in a secure location. You can't retrieve the key value after you close the dialog. If you lose it, you need to create another key. Never share your key with anyone.
