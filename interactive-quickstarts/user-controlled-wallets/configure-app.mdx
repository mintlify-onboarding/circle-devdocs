### What we want to achieve

In this section, we create and initalize a new user and then act as that user to
initiate a transaction. For both steps we need specific parameters. These
parameters are required to initialize a user session and later confirm the
transaction. They also serve determine how your app functions.

Here is a quick overview:

<Parameters>
  <Parameter name="App ID">
    The App ID is your application's unique identifier. It serves as a distinct
    label that sets your application apart from others.
  </Parameter>
  <Parameter name="Encryption Key and User Token">
    They are created when you initiate a user session. The user token is the
    session identifier, and the encryption key is an encryption and decryption
    key that is randomly generated to ensure the security of the session.
  </Parameter>
  <Parameter name="Challenge ID">
    The Challenge ID acts as an identifier that corresponds to a specific
    challenge. A challenge prompts your users to take specific actions, such as
    confirming transactions or executing smart contracts.
  </Parameter>
</Parameters>

In the next few steps, we explain what these parameters are and how to acquire
them!

### Getting your App ID

First up is the App ID. Your App ID serves as a key component that allows you to
configure and tailor your User-Controlled Wallet integration.

You can make a request to the
[`GET /config/entity`](/api-reference/wallets/programmable-wallets/get-entity-config)
API endpoint to obtain your App ID.

<Note>
  **You can also find the App ID directly in the Developer Services Console.**

Open the Developer Console and navigate to the
[Wallets: User-Controlled](https://console.circle.com/wallets/user/configurator)
section of the console. You can view various configuration settings related to
your user-controlled wallet integration. To view your App ID, click
**Configurator** in the left pane.
