You can listen to bridge events that occur during the transfer lifecycle for
each provider in the kit. Events for the built-in CCTP provider follow its
[transaction steps](/bridge-kit/references/error-recovery-and-troubleshooting#transaction-steps-overview).
You can subscribe to each event multiple times with different callbacks.

## Event types

This section lists the CCTP event types to which you can subscribe.

### Approve

Emitted when the transaction is approved. This happens when the transaction
signer has approved the transfer amount on the source chain.

```typescript
kit.on("approve", (payload) => {
  console.log("Approval completed:", payload.values.txHash);
});
```

### Burn

Emitted when tokens are burned on the source chain.



```typescript
kit.on("burn", (payload) => {
  console.log("Burn completed:", payload.values.txHash);
});
```

### Attestation

Emitted when the kit receives the attestation, which serves as proof of the
burn.



```typescript
kit.on("fetchAttestation", (payload) => {
  console.log("Attestation completed:", payload.values.data.attestation);
});
```

### Mint

Emitted when tokens are minted on the destination chain.



```typescript
kit.on("mint", (payload) => {
  console.log("Mint completed:", payload.values.txHash);
});
```

### \*

Listen to all events.



```typescript
kit.on("\*", (payload) => {
  console.log("Event received:", payload);
});
```
