By default, tokens go to the same address as your signing wallet. Bridge Kit
lets you specify a recipient wallet address so that you can send tokens to a
different address.

This example transfers 100.00 USDC from your wallet address on Ethereum to a
different address on Base:


```typescript
// Send from your wallet address to a different recipient address on the destination chain
const result = await kit.bridge({
  from: { adapter, chain: "Ethereum" },
  to: {
    adapter,
    chain: "Base",
    recipientAddress: "0x1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd", // Specify a recipient address
  },
  amount: "100.00",
});
```
