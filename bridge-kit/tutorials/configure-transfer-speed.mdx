By default, Bridge Kit uses CCTP's [Fast Transfer](/cctp) feature to optimize
for speed. However,
[this can incur higher fees](/cctp/technical-guide#cctp-v2-fees). If performance
is not a concern, you can specify a slow transfer speed, which uses CCTP's
Standard Transfer feature.

To balance performance and cost, you can set the maximum fee you want to pay on
fast transfers. The transfer switches to slow if the cost is above your limit.

## Configure slow speed

This code configures a slow transfer speed:


```typescript Typescript
// Slow transfer speed
const result = await kit.bridge({
  from: { adapter, chain: "Ethereum" },
  to: { adapter, chain: "Base" },
  amount: "100.00",
  config: { transferSpeed: "SLOW" }, // Slow transfer speed
});
```

## Configure maximum fee

Set the maximum fee that you want to pay for the CCTP fast burn.

This code configures a maximum fee of 5 USDC:


```typescript Typescript
const result = await kit.bridge({
  from: { adapter, chain: "Ethereum" },
  to: {
    adapter,
    chain: "Base",
  },
  amount: "100.00",
  config: {
    transferSpeed: "FAST", // Fast transfer speed (can be omitted)
    maxFee: "5000000", // Max 5 USDC fee (in smallest units)
  },
});
```
