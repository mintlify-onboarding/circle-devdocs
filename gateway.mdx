Circle Gateway allows anyone to deposit USDC to non-custodial smart contracts on
any supported source chain to create a unified USDC balance. Once deposits are
finalized, the Gateway system can provide an attestation with a single API call
that allows the user to mint USDC instantly on a destination chain, allowing
next-block access to the full balance.

## Background

The current multichain environment presents fundamental challenges. Blockchains
operate as isolated systems with no native way to communicate with each other.
Users holding USDC on Ethereum can't spend their USDC on Solana without a
bridging step, which can be a barrier for adoption for unfamiliar users. Because
there is no way to frictionlessly access USDC held across multiple chains, users
must take extra steps to move their USDC in advance to transact on each
destination chain.

This fragmentation introduces friction across the ecosystem. For end users, it
means manually bridging assets, switching networks, managing chain-specific
balances, and waiting through slow confirmation timesâ€”all of which degrade the
experience of using applications across chains. For businesses, it means
maintaining liquidity on multiple chains at once, constantly rebalancing
capital, and dealing with integration and monitoring overhead. These burdens add
cost, increase operational risk, and slow down development velocity. The outcome
is a fractured liquidity landscape that limits access and usability, both for
individual users and for organizations building on the blockchain.

## How it works

Circle Gateway enables a frictionless USDC experience across the multichain
ecosystem. Users can hold a balance in USDC across multiple chains and use it
instantly on any supported chain, without manual movement, without relying on
external liquidity, and while retaining full ownership and control.

The following is a high-level overview of how Gateway unlocks instant crosschain
transfer of USDC.

### Setting up a balance

1. A Gateway user deposits USDC in a Circle-deployed Gateway Wallet contract.

   The Gateway system observes the deposit transaction onchain and creates a
   unified USDC balance. Latency is dependent on
   [source chain finality](/gateway/references/supported-blockchains#required-block-confirmations).

<Warning>

**Warning:** Directly transferring USDC to the Gateway Wallet contract with a
standard ERC-20 transfer will result in loss of that USDC. You must use one of
the deposit methods on the wallet contract to get a unified USDC balance.

</Warning>

### Using the balance

2. When a Gateway user wants to mint USDC from the unified USDC balance to a
   destination chain, they sign a burn intent. The application that's integrated
   with Gateway submits the burn intent to the Gateway API.

   The Gateway API responds with a signed attestation if the user's unified USDC
   balance is sufficient.

3. The application submits the attestation to the Circle-deployed Gateway Minter
   contract on the destination chain.

   The minter contract mints USDC to the intended recipient's wallet.

   The Gateway system observes the mint transaction onchain, and uses the
   user-signed burn intent to burn USDC from the source chain wallet contract.
